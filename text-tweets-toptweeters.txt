@jhunter46 @BirminghamScot2 @aprilajoyr No books were ever omitted from the bible: it grew rather than shrank.  The apocrypha are, of course, um... apocryphal.  😂

Nicaea did not even discuss the content of the bible.  That idea is a modern myth.

@Jimmy60326773 @LolaInThe405 @IAMINUNISON Nicaea did nothing of this sort. Conspiracy theory there...
@ye_littlefaith The only doctrine which really matters in relation to denominations and theologians being in agreement or not is the Nicene Creed. All the Trinitarian churches agree to this. Plenty of room for us to agree to disagree on more minor and unimportant details in comparison.

@Redsabr @Patrick_02169 @DrFrankTurek The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.
@Redsabr @Patrick_02169 @DrFrankTurek The council of Nicaea did none of this.  It did not canonize anything, nor create copies of anything.  Google Nicaea and the bible.  Sorry but you've been deceived by a modern myth.
@JoKaiGonZo @VT5210 @nicene_hound @SuperVaulty I would love it!
@VT5210 Oh, I will!

I remember me, @writriverdale, @nicene_hound, and @SuperVaulty have a conversation of making children's books sometime after I graduate college.

@hearethree @BtrU_22 @GTS9911 Oh, I missed the word "Doctrine" in your tweet. Take out that word, and it is true.

We've not been talking about the Doctrine (e.g., Nicaea) this entire conversation. Conflating biblical testimony and the formal doctrines is a mistake many make, but I did not expect it from you.
@March111992 @jr_kilby @ahavaysrael1 @RealLathan The council of Nicaea had nothing to do with the canon tho.

It's in the RCC canon but not the protestant one.
@CashPyraxia @AnitaLEll @ng_rippel @thegoodgodabove True; but Nicaea had nothing to do with it.  Indeed nobody ever "decided".  The bible just grew gradually until it included all material with any real claim to come from the apostolic circle (that's the criterion for inclusion).  All done by 400.
@GimmeA3eer @Mainejayy_ @chi_never_shy None of this is true.  Google Nicaea and the bible.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible. 

Also nothing to do with whether Jesus was God: they all knew that already.

Beware bad history.
@k_gaita The council of Nicaea was in 325.  This looks like the Gregorian calculation for Easter, saying which years are leap years?
@OccamsBattleaxe The Nicene Creed is the same for Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants. The other traditions added to this aren't worth falling out over. For the most part I see much working together, e.g. on Bible translation, and on ministry e.g. Foodbanks.

"Something happened at the time of the Council of Nicaea that diminished its opportunity to witness to the world."
@BaynesLeslie:  "Nicaea becomes the stuff of hagiography."
And we are off, Fr. John Chryssavgis is first up with "The First Council of Nicaea:  The Gold Standard or a Squandered Opportunity?"
Baynes:  If the council of Jerusalem had been so clearly settled regarding circumcision, then why did Paul not acknowledge it?  It is because it is only in subsequent memory that Jerusalem produced unity and certainty regarding the question.  So too was the case of Nicaea.
Beginning this afternoon at 4:30 EST, I'll be live tweeting @FordhamOrthodox's Patterson Triennial Conference on Christian Unity.  Our theme is "Nicaea, Conciliarity, and the Future of Christian Unity."
Begins by observing the way that the 2016 Council in Crete framed itself in continuity with the Council of Jerusalem and Nicaea.
Bishop Maxim is running through many of the details of in-fighting among those who were loyal to Nicaea but were unsure how best to proceed in terms of explaining and amplifying the meaning of homoousios.
Bishop Maxim: "The faith of Nicaea is an icon of God, but each generation is called to paint it anew."
Bishop Maxim: Despite our assumptions that Nicaea produced unity, it was a source of great disunity for the early Church.
Bishop Maxim: My argument is that the seeming failure of Nicaea was actually achievement for the Church.  The Creed opened the door to dialectical conciliarity.
Bishop Maxim: The willingness of the fathers at Constantinople to amend the shortcomings of Nicaea is the great model of opportunity for us.  The upcoming anniversary is time for us to be alert to this theological culture of ongoing reflection.
Bishop Maxim: While Nicaea led to considerable controversies and divisions it also opened new theological tools.
Dr. Baynes, shifting attention now to Eusebius' account of Nicaea and drawing comparisons to the pattern established by Luke in Acts.
Dr. Fiano's goal is talk about the Nicaea not as a precise historic event but in the transformation in the discourse of dogma, achieved in part through law.
Dr. Kilby:  "What, at the time of the event, did the theologians of Nicaea think they were agreeing to?"
Dr. Kilby: The very mark of the success of Nicaea is that we are released from having to know the historical details to appreciate its genuine significance.
Dr. Lloyd begins by noting that we might be able to group the previous speakers in one of two "moods":  those who find "comfort" in Nicaea as a common base, and those who see Nicaea as a kind of "democratizing" force in the Church.
Dr. Lloyd, restating that these are "moods" not camps or methodologies.  But he is also not so sure that they can fit neatly together.  The democratizing impulse seems to question the comfort that Nicaea provides, he suggests.
Dr. Lloyd:  What everyone agrees is that Nicaea was significant.
Dr. Lloyd: There is something quite like negative theology when we try to understand what happened at Nicaea.
Dr. Meawad pursuing the link between Nicaea and Ethics.
Dr. Meawad: A modern virtue such as tolerance is more meaningful when connected to something like the conciliarity of Nicaea.  You cannot have authentic tolerance without truth.
Dr. Meawad: Nicaea demonstrates that to know God, you must know something of who he is, this requires doctrinal understanding.
Dr. Meawad: Nicaea is important because it provides a foundation is at risk of being forgotten.
Ethics via Nicaea means that there is no usefulness of rules apart from the link to the truth of God.
Fiano: Nicaea is a discursive stance in the production of truth--dogma.
First up this morning is Dr. Stephen Meawad, "Nicaea and the Legacy of Truth:  Bounded Virtue and Ascetical Spirituality"
Fr John now running through a number of social issues such slavery, philanthropy, etc, to show that the bishops at Nicaea failed to seize the moment.
Fr. Bathrellos begins by walking us through the theological (Trinitarian) debates at Nicaea.
Fr. Bathrellos is now running through the turns taken in  historical theology over the past fifty years with respect to the newfound focus on Trinitarian theology (Nicaea + Cappadocians) and the impact this had on so many other aspects of the theological enterprise.
Fr. Behr:  The Creed of Nicaea does not address these concerns at all.  Rather it leaves all of these debates open.
Fr. Bogdan:  The Christological reading of Old Testament epiphanies permeates the whole of Orthodox theology both before and after Nicaea.  But this is not the scholarly consensus.
Fr. Chryssavgis building to the point that the memorialization of Nicaea leads to an innovation in the sense it spawns a conservatism that did not previously exist.  The Church's dynamism is cut short.
Fr. Chryssavgis:  "Nicaea begins to issue restrictions upon the lower clergy."  . . . "this is a council of bishops, not priests."
Fr. Chryssavgis: “Nicaea is first and foremost a triumph of imperial propaganda and only secondarily an articulation of creedal doctrine."
Fr. John does not see Nicaea to have been primarily concerned about doctrine (Arianism), but rather about jurisdiction and episcopal authority.
Fr. John opens by reviewing the dramatic changes in the way that scholars have thought about Nicaea over the past generation.
Fr. John, in sum, the specter of Paul of Samosata frames both the terminology and the patterns of memorialization that drive the accounts of Nicaea and the conflict with Arius.
Fr. John: "Nicaea did absolutely nothing to affirm the role of women in the Church, the single most important driver in Church growth."
He is now exploring "open-mindedness" in a similar way.  The concept of truth requires a dogmatic pursuit, but conciliarity (Nicaea) requires dialogue, which demonstrates the virtue of open-mindedness in the pursuit of dogmatic truth.
He suggests that this is an under appreciated aspect of the significance of Nicaea in scholarship.
In effect, Fr. Chryssavgis is arguing that we woefully overdue the significance of Nicaea.  What was possible at Nicaea has been eroding ever-since.
In sum, Fr. Bogdan is making note that the pre-Nicaean patterns of Christocentric readings of Hebrew theophanies continues beyond Nicaea and this is something completely missed in the current scholarship.
In sum, Fr. John is arguing that Nicaea might have provided the way to abolish slavery, mitigate poverty, etc., but instead it bishops looked to securing their authority both in the empire and among the believers.
It must have come as an extraordinary surprise to bishops that they were being summoned by Constantine to Nicaea. 

The first occasion of religious soft power employed by the state.
Meawad arguing that Nicaea came to believed to be "spirit-led" because of the personal quality and ascesis of many of the participants.  It was not only their cerebral talents, it was their way of life.  The self-controlled ascetic.
Meawad juxtaposing the disposition of the bishops assembled at Nicaea (and their understanding of ethics) from the contemporary.
Next up (our very good friend) @FrJohnBehr.  His title is "Under the Shadow of the Samosatene:  From Antioch 268 to Nicaea 325."
Next up His Grace, Bishop Maxim (Vasiljevic) of Los Angelos whose title is "Re-Reception of the Faith of Nicaea Then and Now."
Next up is Fr. Bogdan Bocur from @stvlads whose paper is "Christophanic Exegesis and the Nicene Faith:  Patristic Authors and Scholars of Patristics."
Next up, Dr. Vincent Lloyd, "Nicaea, Democracy, and Negative Theology."
O'Regan reminds us that Newman was responding to Gibbon and his jaundiced view of Nicaea and the institutional church.
O'Regan: If our common intent is to conceive a viable sense of tradition and if we are to have non relativizing sense of the achievement of Nicaea, then a "cut-back" version of Newman is best option.
O'Regan: both Hart and Newman take a similar view of the role of Nicaea in revealing/development of doctrine.  The basic logic of Nicaea for both is soteriological.
Second day of the Patterson Conference on Christian Unity, "Nicaea, Conciliarity and the Future of Christianity" about to begin.  First up is @BaynesLeslie "The Council of Jerusalem and the Council of Nicaea."
Siecienski:  Pelikan believed that the Church believed more implicitly than it taught explicitly.  This enabled him to agree that the post-Nicaea fathers didn't know "more" than their predecessors.  This was less than Newman's view.
The canons of Nicaea did not arrive in India until the early fifth century.  Some of these were impossible to implement given local structures.
Third speaking of the morning is Dr. Emanuel Fiano.  His talk is "Nicaea and the Dogmatic Order of Late Antiquity."
Torrance turning now to the early reception of Nicaea to understand how this event and its creed became symbol of the whole of Orthodox Christian teaching.
Torrence:  Is Nicaea the lowest common denominator between Christians?
Up next, Ed Siecienski, "Nicaea, Pelican, and the Legitimacy of Doctrinal Development."
We are back from lunch, next up, Fr. Alexis Torrance, "A Symbol of the Whole:  The Nicene Creed and Dogmatic Minimalism?"
With a twist on the classic line, @BaynesLeslie adds: "What has Nicaea to do with Jerusalem?"
@Gallo190391 Woah, I didn't know this before. @SuperVaulty @writriverdale @nicene_hound @gabrielsyme08 @AaronIrber @KatarinyaMariya @EvergreenAutumn @Cererean @CathStickMan @HeebPunished @NotCathAme @LeHobbitFan @Heorot_ @ASpaceSlav @NotDiogenes

I just randomly remembered that a major factor of Germanic warriors converting to Nicene Christianity, away from paganism and Arianism, was their marrying of Catholic princesses.

That's honestly adorable.

1/ The Nicene Creed, like the scriptures generally, is widely conflated with later Trinitarian belief in which the one God is the Trinity and in which each hyptostasis of the Trinity is "God himself" (i.e. ho theos). This is not the Nicene faith.
1/ The consubstantiality clause of the Nicene Creed implies nothing regarding the hierarchical relations between the Father and the Son.
1/3 Calling the Nicene Creed "Trinitarian" is misleading for two reasons: 1) It implies that the Creed identifies the one God as the Trinity and not as the Father, and 2) It implies that the Creed is intended to be an explanation of the Triune Godhead.
1/9 It is taken for granted that the Nicene Creed promotes the same egalitarian tendencies regarding the Trinity as does the Athanasian Creed. The Son's homoousian status at Nicaea is viewed through an Athanasian rule: "Such as the Father is; such is the Son..."
10/ Thus Nicene salvation originates in God himself, the Father, wrought through his homoousiuan Son, and does not originate in Christ himself, the homoiousian Son, a divine creation of God. God's nature, not a divine nature, becomes the active ingredient in salvation.
11/ Ironically, Nicaea's redemptive vision safeguards the Father's primacy &amp; participation in salvation.
2/ But the Athanasian Creed is really presenting a modified vision of the Trinity. The Father's Nicene distinctions as the "one God" and the "[one] Almighty," along with the Son's distinction as the "one Lord," are appropriated by the Athanasian Trinity.
4/ In comparison, the Nicene Creed holds the homoousian relationship between the Father &amp; the Son in tension with the Father's unique status as almighty creator God. Nicaea exhibits no concern to smooth out the Father's monarchy into a "coequal" trinity of persons.
4/ What the Father's unique identity as God means for Nicaea is unclear but I think the titles given him offer a clue. In distinction to the Son, through whom all things were made, the Father alone is the almighty creator. The one God, God himself, is the source of all things.
5/ Consequently, the Nicene Creed affirms the homoousios not in order to preclude all distinctions between Father and Son but in order to preclude the creation of the Son. The Son's divinity is not a created kind of divinity but a begotten kind of divinity.
8/ So what's at stake here is not that the Father &amp; the Son are identical in every way (at Nicaea they are not), but that the salvation achieved by the Son is the salvation of God himself. In the homoousian clause the Father becomes the source of Christ's subsequent redemption.
9/ Despite there being little biblical warrant for such a conception, the Nicene Creed implies that this shared divine nature secures the authenticity of Christ's salvation. God's nature, not God's spirit, was at work in Christ as the redemptive catalyst.
@1111Zion1111 @unitarian415217 "Trinity" isn't in the Nicene Creed. The Creed identifies the one God as the Father.
@AlFinlandi The Nicene Creed says that the Father is uniquely designated "the one God." My understanding is that the Son and Spirit are God only in the sense that they share the Father's nature. The divine nature is tri-hypostatic but the Father is who the one God is.
@AlFinlandi Was St John contemporaneous with the Nicene Creed?
@BrazenHisser The Nicene Creed identifies the Father as the "one God" and Christ as the "one Lord" as well. So it seems like these identifiers are not meant to be rearranged???
@CalebDixonSmith @NoWarChristian @ifffster Begetting is a form of causation (what else would it be?). Traditional language says the Son is eternally "generated" by the Father. (To say otherwise denies the Nicene Creed, which @NoWarChristian does deny most unfortunately.) Only the Father is uncaused, autotheos.
@ChristIsComing5 Not the one God of the Nicene Creed.
@DavidPaternostr The Nicene Creed doesn't profess a triune God.
@GrofKonstantin Is the Son ungenerated as the Father is ungenerated? 

I think Nicaea had yet to nail down exactly what it meant for the Son to be true God from true God.
@HwsEleutheroi In distinction to the homoousian Son, the Nicene Creed identifies the Father alone as the "one God" and almighty creator.
@Inwardman3Ne @unitarian415217 @SpeedWatkins The Nicene Creed grounds Christian monotheism in the idea that the Father of Christ is the one almighty creator God. The Son and Spirit are "God" in the sense that they possess the Father's nature.
@J20Credwell @henryjwallis @_JeanLannes @HighSeaHound It sounds heretical b/c popular modern Trinitarianism posits (contra Nicaea) that Christ just is the one true God, the Almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth. The reasons for this are complicated but have to do with the emergence of new theological values.
@MicheleKellie I'm not sure what you are getting at. It makes sense to me that the Father's word is a perfect manifestation of the Father's mind. The Nicene Creed articulates this by stating that the Son is "true God (qualitatively) from [the] true God (i.e. God himself)".
@NoWarChristian @ifffster The Nicene Creed demands 1) that the Father causes the Son (Christ is begotten of the Father), and 2) that God the Father is the one God.
@NoWarChristian @ifffster The Nicene Creed was created in order to affirm that the Son is of the "same" nature as God, not of a "similar" nature as God.
@NoWarChristian @ifffster The Nicene Crees does not identify the Son as the one God. It says the Son shares in God's (i.e. the Father's) divine nature.
@NoWarChristian @ifffster Why does the Nicene Creed affirm that the one God is the Father?
@NotAllKnowing There's no proof text for "from" in the NT (or Nicene Creed).
@PalamismRspctr Only familiar with Nicaea
@PalamismRspctr The former. The Constantinople creed seems consistent with Nicaea to me and it was drafted in Constantine's city.
@PaulManata @RandalRauser On point #1, even as late as Nicaea the only one God Christians believed in was the Father. The Son and Spirit were not understood to be "God" in the same way as God himself, the Father almighty.
@SlaveToMary Then what is the Nicene Creed of 325?
@TheOtherPaul2 The Nicene Creed is not Trinitarian in the conventional sense. 

The main content of New Testament eschatology anticipates something like the Constantinian overthrow of Greco-Roman paganism and the conversion of the empire to the worship of Israel's ancestral God.
@UnitarianChrist The Athanasian Creed identifies the one God as the Trinity. The Nicene Creed identifies the one God as the Father Almighty, the autotheos.
@andrew_deford "Himself" being the Father? 

The Nicene fathers believed the Son and Spirit were dependent upon and caused by the Father, the divine Monarch.
@andrewboonedog @ostrachan I don't mean to imply that Strachan is actually non-Nicaean. The Nicene Creed is Monarchic.
@bethfelkerjones Nicene orthodoxy "looks orthodox"
@ekkiet According to Nicene faith there are three divine persons, one of whom is God, the Father Almighty, who is the source and cause of the Son and Spirit.
@henryjwallis @jacobhuneycutt_ The Monarchy is a non-negotiable for Nicene faith.
@highlyaaronic I'm a Nicene Creed-Onlyist now :(
@ian_wragg58 @jawadbalaghi He can. That's how many early Christians conceived of the Trinity. The Father is "Almighty" as the Nicene Creed states.
@jmmooreo @PhilipBPayne God is the source of the Son in Nicene orthodoxy and the creator of the Son in Arianism.
@noah_nonsense @PaulManata @RandalRauser Because the early church determined that the Nicene Creed defines the faith.
@one_not_three The Trinity doctrine (i.e. the one God is the Trinity) was not taught at Nicaea either.
@ostrachan The Nicene Creed doesn't demand egalitarian relations between the one God, the Son, and the Spirit, if that's what you're getting at.
@paleomexicano @ReformedBritt @merelyjwright The Nicene Creed doesn't address the authoritative relations between the Father and the Son (though it certainly does imply that the Son is the agent of the Father's will).
@snemes2 Popular Trinitarianism is largely at odds with the doctrine of God posited in the Nicene Creed.
@supremacy7 @soli_Jesum @Jesus_porvida The image would be better if the center circle read deity/divinity. The one God of Nicaea is the Father.
@unitarian415217 @SpeedWatkins Belief in the Trinity is not incompatible with the belief that the Father is the only true God. The Nicene Creed identifies the Father alone as the one God.
@wandlearner @ifffster The Athanasian Creed seemingly holds that the Trinity is the one God, not the Father. In the Nicene Creed the Father is distinct from the other hypostases in that he is the "one God," "almighty," and "maker of all things."
Christians: Is the Nicene Creed "God-breathed"?
Christians: Which generally matters more to you: shared theological convictions (e.g. the Nicene Creed) or shared moral convictions (e.g. views on sexuality/immigration/politics)?
It seems like the logic of Nicaea demands that the scripture, the word of God, be something other than a created thing since it spoken/thought/emanated from God. But how in the world would scripture then be integrated into the identity of either Christ or the Spirit?
Nicene is favored over Apostle's. No love for Athanasian. https://t.co/JVNmEFuG6p
The Athanasian Creed states: "The Father is God, the Son is God, the Holy Spirit is God. Yet there are not three gods; there is but one God."

Does this equate the one God with the divine nature/Trinity? Does this contradict the Nicene Creed's "there is one God, the Father"?
The Nicene Creed identifies the Father as the "one God" and as the "maker of all things." Within the logic of the Creed are these unique attributes of the Father's person or can/should they be attributed also the Son/Holy Spirit?
The conservative, spiritualizing, &amp; non-apocalyptic theology that blossomed in the Christianized Greek world justified the liberation of the nations from idolatrous polytheism, divinized kings, &amp; pagan sexual variety. In its own time, Nicaea was a kind of Liberation Theology.
What was the dominant Christian stance on military service (vis-a-vis war/violence) in the ante-Nicene period?
Which came first, the New Testament canon or the Nicene Creed?
"The work of our hands" is the dogma of the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws. 
The line destined to save Mankind from this "work of our hands" came through those typified by Noah which were/are the Merovingians thus making these Vons the unwitting Target of those who created the DOGMA.
"turn to doing good" as Cain failed to do, by failing to "release the prisoners" by ABOLISHING the dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that JUSTIFY them in SLAUGHTERING THEIR OWN PEOPLE...... as they are NOW DOING.

@CraterEarth1 I honestly believe they are trying to create a better world, a Paradise on earth. Unfortunately, every Empire they have built on their Mold (Nicene Creed/Mosaic laws) has failed. The world needs loving Shepherds, not warring Kings who can abuse their subjects without consequences
A House without Love in it dies &amp; such will be the way of EVERY EMPIRE built by the Kings &amp; RCC until they ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that cut them off from O, the SOURCE of True UNCONDITIONAL Love for all Humanity. 
The Serpent that cannot shed its skin dies.
A Man tells his wife she is IMPOSSIBLE to live with &amp;must CHANGE if she wants their marriage to work. So, she changes the color of her lipstick. THIS is comparable to the current change we see in Canon Law. ABOLISHMENT of the Nicene Creed/Mosaic laws is the CHANGE the world NEEDS
A Mosaic Law says that any man who marries a DIVORCED woman commits ADULTERY. 
This law makes Charles and Harry adulterers/illegitimate rulers. They really need to ABOLISH the Mosaic Laws and Nicene Creed at the upcoming Ecumenical Council.... Synod at Rome
A good start would be ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. 

Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness and become the Good Shepherds they were created to be.
ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. 

Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness.
ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and the Mosaic Laws is the ONLY WAY for them to free their Collective Mind of the Curse THEY PLACED on themselves.
AGAINST the very GOD WHO CREATED THEM thus denying themselves the Crown of Favor/ Life that comes from THEIR GOD ALONE. Voting for the Nicene Creed would have been voting AGAINST their own BEST INTEREST just as embracing Roman Catholicism and the
Abolishing the Nicene Code and Mosaic Laws is the ONLY way Horus will ever regain his Eye and Favor with the True Eternal God,....O.
Abolishing the dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws is NOT about destroying the Great family. It's about TRANSFORMING them into something GREATER than they currently are. 
It's about the CHANGE...ie ...a TRANSFIGURATION.. from a Living Soul into a Life-giving Spirit.
Accepting the Nicene Creed is comparable to the Son of the Spirit RIPPING his own PEDIGREE from O to PIECES .....and SEVERING his relationship with O forever.
As I watch the House of Von/ Windsor stepping into the trap that will rob them of their Crown, I not only feel sickened, I also feel compelled to remind them that their brother, Arius, did not fall for this TRAP while voting at the Council of Nicea on the nature of God &amp; His Son.
As long as the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws exist the world remains under the Law Covenant with the God of War, Jehovah, &amp; there will be NO LASTING PEACE because he is the Man-God/King of Armies/War such as we see (Kings) now SLAUGHTERING PEOPLE all over this planet for CONTROL.
Charles, the Synod of Satan will convene next year. It's primary purpose is to write the Death Warrant of the Windsors/Danes ...and then get them to sign off on it. 
The two Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were shun for it,... but they SAVED your asses.
Control over Death/RCC/Rome is simply the ILLUSION/trap that is going to get them all annihilated. They only have one Narrow Pathway for regaining Favor and saving their own lives: ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. If they fail to do this... they are doomed.
DOGMA of the Great Family of Kings/Babylon which are summed up in the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that make these Kings into God and THEIR laws into the Laws of God. 
Cain failed O, his Creator, because he wanted to identify with his own Great Family MORE than his own Creator.
Death is very UNFORGIVING. 
The ONLY WAY for the Saints to escape this Vengeance/Vendetta of Jehovah, the AVENGER of the DEFRAUDED ONES, is to ABOLISH the dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.... which are the SOURCE of the CONTENTION/ the ENMITY that exists between
Do they truly dare to rob God of HIS PLANET/House,... and think they can get away with it by DENYING HIS very EXISTENCE?

EVER been aligned with the Protestants is doomed if they don't wtfu &amp; ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws which empower their own Great Family (Catholic Godhead) to kill them i.e... PLUCK this RIGHT EYE from their Body so neither they nor ANY of their OFFSPRING can EVER rise
Either the Vons REMOVE their own CURSE and restore their Favor with O via purification, i.e.. ABOLISHMENT of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws, ....or the RCC will RADICALLY REMOVE these Protestant heathens from their midst in the next century and burn them in the Greek / Etruscan
Even in his blindness, Samson (who typified the Vons / Merovingians) managed to bring their Philistine Temple down around them which is EXACTLY what O expects from His BARBARIAN Viking Sons. Dissolution of the Nicene Creed, their Foundation Stone, ...should be a good start.
HORN"... whose spiritual OFFSPRING eventually CREATED the Protestant Religion... was alive and STANDING steadfast in their Faith in their Creator, O, in the days of that Ecumenical Council of Nicea.
Since Rome is Ishmael the Council had to identify both Jesus &amp; John with Ishmael.
Ham was like the Merovingian, Martin Luther. He saw his Father's/RCC's "nakedness" and told them about it, because he knew that the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws had lost O's Favor for them. Their response to his revelation that they had lost O's Favor/were "naked" like Adam, was to
He cannot control the Vatican, which means "Divine Serpent". The only solution is to remove its poison ..i.e.. the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic laws, &amp; the belief that the Serpent's voice is the Voice of God when it is simply the voice of the Great Family of Kings, Molech/ Jehovah of
He hangs on to the DOGMA that HE is God (reflected in the Nicene Creed) and the Mosaic Laws (a modified version of the Hammurabi Code) which are a reflection of HIS own laws which are to be recognized as the laws of God because HE is God... according to his adopted dogma.
How do I know these things? 
The Scroll has been opened to me,... so I can SEE INSIDE. (Rev 5:2)
Thus, I can tell my Viking Brothers that in order to LOOSEN those SEALS of DEATH that bind them to the CURSE they MUST ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic laws.
I CHALLENGE the LEGITIMACY of the Royal Family of Great Britain. The Nicene Creed is a Statement of the LEGITIMACY of Ishmael, the Son of Jehovah, the God of Armies, but I do not see a Statement of Legitimacy for those who claim to be the Prince of Peace, ie,.. Son of the Spirit.
I'm telling you all of this NOW while you STILL have the Power to SAVE your House. If you do not ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws &amp; REMOVE that goddamn Crown from your head, every Viking on this planet will be dead by the end of the next century.
If I can gain Understanding by learning from YOUR MADNESS, (something we share in common) then I am INDEBTED to you. 
"Just as iron sharpens iron so the face of one man sharpens the face of another". 
So I continue pointing to the Door out: ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws.
If Jesus had accepted the offer they would have eventually killed him anyway because Jesus OPPOSED THEIR DOGMA represented in the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
It's the reason the RCC MURDERED both John and Jesus. 
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from this madness
If the Great Family of Kings doesn't abolish the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws they will kill all commoners &amp; then CANNIBALIZE EACH OTHER until they all PERISH. 
There is no Paradise for these men until they embrace the purpose for which they were created...to BECOME GOOD SHEPHERDS.
If there is ever to be a LASTING Peace on Earth the world needs Shepherds not Kings &amp; priests. These Kings/Priests are in need of a TRANSFIGURATION, a CHANGE. They simply need to REMOVE their CROWNS and pick up their SHEPHERD'S STAFF by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws
If this Prophetic Woman (also mentioned in Revelation 12:1-5) is not legitimate then my VIKING BROTHERS who are born from her are NOT LEGITIMATE either. The Nicene Creed REJECTS HER LEGITIMACY, thus it rejects THEIR legitimacy.
If you FAIL to do this..... and FAIL to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws,.... NOT ONE VIKING will survive the next century. 

As it is written, so it shall be.
If your desire to be God &amp; Moral Authority of the WORLD is greater than your desire to be the Good Shepherd ...then you are DOOMED. Hanging on to the dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws SCREAMS the fact that you prefer the role of King/God .. over that of Good Shepherd.
In order to ensure the FUTURE of our HOME/ PLANET we must ABOLISH the DOGMA of the Past that has DESTROYED our Present. This DESTRUCTIVE DOGMA is represented by the Nicene Creed (that denies the existence of the Eternal Invisible God of Love and Peace)... and the Mosaic Laws
In the Biblical narrative Job learns the true nature of O which he did not know prior to his suffering. Thus, the Story is NOT about Job/ the Saints REGAINING their WEALTH and STATUS but about regaining their RELATIONSHIP with O, ....the EXISTENCE of WHOM the Nicene Creed DENIES.
Instead of destroying lives as Akhenaten did the WISE move for the Vons would be to DESTROY the HERESY in THEMSELVES by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed (that allows them to replace God) and the Mosaic Laws that give them the power to kill anyone who defies them and enslave those who
Is every King and priest a rapist and a murderer? No. But their Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws leaves that option open to them. King David certainly got away with rape and murder.. Thus, there can never be peace under their system. Without Justice there can be no Peace
It is their DOGMA of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that IDENTIFY THEM as Swords of Jehovah/War.... instead of the peaceful Good Shepherds of The Creator, O.
Jesus as the Son of God in order to draw HIS and John the Baptist's followers into their Fold at their last Great Reset with the Council of Nicea,... that they would also be FORCED to ACCEPT the same books that Jesus and John recognized as "inspired". (With a little RCC editing)
John the Baptist &amp; Jesus both belonged to that Composite Body of RESISTANCE to the "holy ones" identified Biblically in the Book of Daniel as the "rebellious little horn". Both of these men attacked the HYPOCRISY &amp; BLASPHEMY of the DOGMA represented in the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic
Learn from your past ERRORS so things will go well for you. LOOK at who inhabits your former Wall, the FIRMAMENT, now. 
THAT is the future of the Paradise you are attempting to build now if you fail to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws that constitute the Old Law Covenant.
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness and ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that keep all mankind alienated from O, the True God of Love, Wisdom, and Understanding.
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness and abandon the Nicene Creed that destroyed them.
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness and lead mankind out of this Spiritual Hell they have created with their Mosaic (do as I say, not as I do) Laws and Nicene Creed that identifies THEM as the heartless God who rules this planet.
Let us pray our Viking Brothers, the Saints, AWAKEN from their madness and realize their FAITH in O, their own creator, is being TESTED. 
They need to end World War 3 now and ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws before it is too late for them.
Let us pray our Viking Brothers/ Saints, AWAKEN from their MADNESS, END WW3 now &amp; ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws which is the ONLY WAY to PURIFY the Dark Side of the RCC that produces the Evil Spirits.
It is the ONLY WAY for the Saints to become the Good Shepherd again.
Listen carefully because this is the soundest advice you are ever going to hear,... which is in reference to MISTAKES our FOREFATHERS MADE that NEED to be CORRECTED. ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws before they abolish you.
Most High at the RCC. 
If I had all the Power in the world I would do one thing: I would use that  Power to ABOLISH the dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws because I know that THESE are the WEAPONS that are going to KILL my Viking Brothers and Sisters.
My Viking Brothers CANNOT defeat Ishmael, ...but they CAN prevent Ishmael from winning.... by SURVIVING. They can only SURVIVE if the Nicene Code and Mosaic laws are ABOLISHED. End Game. RESET.
My Viking Brothers need to wtfu because the screwing you are about to get will be comparable to the screwing you gave. 
You need to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws... and pick up the Good Shepherd's Staff while you still can.
My Viking Brothers, you MUST ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.... because THESE are the things that are KILLING YOU. THESE are the things that DELIVERED YOU, and your people, into the HANDS of DEATH. 
RELEASE yourself and its PRISONERS. 
Let the prisoners go FREE.
My greatest fear is that, once they CONSOLIDATE their Power in Rome, the Great Family of Kings is going to screw it up by keeping the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws which will eventually tear it all down AGAIN as no Biblical Empire built on this Mold has ever lasted, such as Egypt,
Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws represent. 
The world is awaiting their AWAKENING,...the lifting of the Curse,..    which REQUIRES them to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
Nicene Creed is a SLAP in the FACE to their own GOD, ...O,.. which will result in the House of Von's continued loss of HIS FAVOR. I liken these three heroes who voted against the Nicene Creed to Meshach (Michael), Shadrach, and Abednego.
Once again, the Vons will be OUSTED from Heaven, the RULING POSITION, because they failed to listen to Wisdom when she spoke to them ... ADVISING them to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
Let us pray our Viking Brother AWAKENS from his madness before it's too late.
Paul realized that the DOGMA of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws is what was PREVENTING ABEL'S RESURRECTION, so he left his service to the Great Family of Kings/RCC/Godhead and THEIR DOGMA.... to become a Good Shepherd... looking forward to the Kingdom of God, O,... the Creator.
Prince Charles, tell the priests of the RCC that the only way you will accept the position as Pope is if they ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws BEFORE you accept. Your whole House... and EVERY Viking on this planet is as good as dead if you don't.
Psychopaths are above their own laws. They do what THEY WANT and the rest of the world can go to HELL. 
These are the men who created the Mosaic Laws and the Nicene Creed that makes THEM... GOD of this planet. 
Nobody can judge them. They are untouchable....even by their own Laws https://t.co/HL0Ownfshx
So basically, the Council of Nicaea was claiming that Jesus was endorsing Satan. 
There were two Vons/Merovingians who refused to vote WITH this Council AGAINST THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS and were shunned because of this. But, this shows us that this Biblical "rebellious little
So when the Vons are DEPOSED in the next century, it will be comparable to "Satan being cast down out of heaven." 
THIS is the future of the Vons / Isaac if they don't ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws,... which is the very Purpose for which O created them.
So, I encourage my Viking Brothers to make it IMPOSSIBLE for the RCC to kill them by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws... i.e ...the Power of the Ring that sucks the very Essence of Life, the Soul/Beauty, FROM ALL WHO WEAR IT ....as well as all who kneel to its Power.
So, next century this Composite Man/Godhead.... will SACRIFICE all the Vons for HIS blood guilt. The Vons/Vikings could have averted their own destruction if they had turned the Ship AROUND and ABOLISHED the Nicene Code and Mosaic Laws. Paybacks are Hell. Let us pray he AWAKENS.
So, while you are standing there with your hands in your pants.. whistling Dixie ...as you watch ARIANISM being DEMONIZED... you should take a look at the back of your shirt and read the sign placed there by the promoters of the Nicene Creed that says, "PLEASE kick my ass!"
Stepping into a trap they CANNOT escape. 
The world will see the greatest TRANSFER OF WEALTH in the history of this planet if the Vons don't nip this Blindside Rose in the bud by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. 
It is their ONLY way out of this where they can remain
THEIR DOGMA of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. 
The House of Windsor belongs to the SAME Composite Body that John and Jesus did. 
They will share the SAME FATE as their Brothers if they don't ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws which were the WEAPONS used by the Roman
THEY are destined to become the Good Shepherd once they overcome the dogma of Death, the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic laws, which is what brought them down in the first place. 
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness...that prevents this Good Shepherd from being BORN.
THIS is the reason the Pope is identified as God because HE represents Moses by promoting his Mosaic Laws. 
And, since the Father and Son are one and the same, ...according to the Nicene creed,... this makes the Pope the Christ.
That loop we are on, represented by the Nicene Code and Mosaic Laws, have DISTORTED the Face of this Man for thousands of years. CHANGE is NECESSARY before that twisted Face kills us all .....again. Let us pray he AWAKENS soon.
That old serpent promoted the dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. We are waiting for that old serpent to shed that old skin, that Old Covenant, for the New. https://t.co/J7EJAdJpAd
The "fruit" of the FORBIDDEN TREE makes one experience what it is like to be God. It is the ultimate drug &amp;  high but it is TOXIC &amp; DESTROYS FAMILIES. 
The Kings need to "Just say no" to this "fruit", the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws, that make THEM know the joys ....of being God.
The "seed" symbolizes ORIGIN thus it is the ORIGIN of The Serpent versus the ORIGIN of the Woman that gives rise to this ENMITY. It is the EXACT controversy that existed between Ishmael and Isaac. (The Nicene Creed is Ishmael's Statement of LEGITIMACY.
The Ark is about the survival of Mankind, NOT humankind,...which is the reason the Great Family of Kings at Rome will NOT ALLOW any of their "prisoners to go free" of their control mechanisms, ...the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
The Carnage of War has made the Kings mentally ill and there is no PowerPoint presentation in the world that is going to convince these men that there's anything wrong with them.
Thus, the Good Shepherd needs to stand up and ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws which
The Council of Nicea was an Ecumenical Council that resolved the issue of Arianism, a doctrine that held that Christ was NOT a Divine but a CREATED being. 
Since the 18th Dynasty Rulers were CREATED by O, the dismissal of Arianism made all rulers of the 18th Dynasty ILLEGITIMATE.
The Good Shepherd does NOT need the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws. All he needs is his VOICE. 
His sheep recognize his Voice and they follow WILLINGLY because they know HE CARES for them. 
Thus, the Pope is NOT the Good Shepherd because he relies on this DOGMA to control people.
The Good Shepherd is in for the Battle of his Life, but first he has to WAKE UP and see the PREDICAMENT he is in because right now he is DREAMING that he is in charge. 
If he doesn't remove that Ball &amp; Chain from his neck.. ie, Nicene Creed/Mosaic Laws he will die in his "sleep".
The Great Family of Kings ARE Babylon the Great and their Priesthood, RCC, ...which promotes the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws that allow them to DESTROY FAMILIES, traffic DRUGS, PROSTITUTE WOMEN and CHILDREN, etc ...is the Harlot,... thus these actresses are representing THEM.
The Great Family of Kings BUILD and then they DESTROY what they have built so they can BUILD BACK BETTER. 
Material things and technology improve but the MORALITY is WORSE because the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws are INCAPABLE of making anyone MORAL. 
In fact, quite the opposite.
The Great Reset orchestrated by this Great Family in the 4th century at the Council of Nicea, inculcated the writings of this MADMAN who had OPPOSED their DOGMA represented in the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws, into their new Bible as if Paul were endorsing them when he was NOT.
The Jesuits are winning, and rightly so, but this is not going to end well for the Nazis/Vons if they fail to make the necessary changes ASAP. Abolishing the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws will initiate the PURIFICATION of the RCC which is the CHANGE we all NEED.
The Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws are an ERROR, ...a MISTAKE that has killed hundreds of millions and will eventually kill all Life on this planet if this ERROR is not corrected by ABOLISHING them. 

Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness.
The Nicene Creed identifies the King's ruling over us now as God. The Mosaic Laws /Hammurabi Code were written by THEIR forefathers, the Great Family of Sin. These are the SAME MEN who tossed their Mother, Wisdom, out into the streets in order to promote the Laws of Sin, aka, the
The Nicene Creed makes Ishmael both God and Son of God. Charles, you are so SCREWED. You have one move now. One. And, it doesn't require you to kill anybody. Make the WISE move. Reject that goddamn Crown. 
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness.
The Nicene Creed makes the Pope God. All religions based on the Mosaic Laws do worship the same God, the Pope. 
So this is an inaccurate statement because all religions do NOT worship the Godhead of the Kings ie..the Pope. People like me believe in O, the True God of the Universe https://t.co/hkU2SRb0J5
The Nicene Creed promotes Ishmael as the HEIR of this planet over the Vons who are typified Biblically as Isaac, thus it is just a matter of time before this DOGMA DESTROYS this rebellious little horn/ Vons. Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN before they die in their madness.
The ONLY OUT for the 18th Dynasty /Merovingians/Vons is to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws while they still have the opportunity. 
If they fail to do this,... this Curse from Abraham, the Man they recognize as their own Patriarch, will ANNIHILATE them.
The ONLY way the Good Shepherd will ever be safe is to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws and the Kings/Dragon will fight him tooth and nail to prevent this because they want this Good Shepherd/Saint dead. 
It is by THOSE LAWS they will CONVICT him ...as they did Jesus.
The Pope prayed to the Mother that had made him, (the Son of the Slave Girl), into God, the Ruler of this World,..which is the reason he needs the world to accept the Nicene Creed. 
Biblically he is a typified as both ISHMAEL, Son of God's Wife &amp; ISRAEL, Son of the Most High God.
The Roman Catholic Church is Satan. 
The Protestant Church is the Son of Satan.
Both are based on the same Mosaic Laws and same Nicene Creed that makes these KINGS into the ONLY GODS on this planet. 
These men are ATHEISTS... PRETENDING to serve a GOD they do NOT believe exists
The White Lady's advice to the House of Von is that they can do this the EASY WAY or the HARD WAY. 
The Easy way is to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws &amp; there will be a LASTING PEACE on the Earth, but they will lose their favorite Game,.. War,.. because it will be no more.
The Windsors (and Danes) will get to know first hand what it is truly like to be a Slave and be FORCED to live under the THUMB of THEIR OWN GREAT FAMILY. 
If the Windsors/Vikings accept the dogma of the Nicene Creed, they are ADMITTING they have NO CLAIM to their own throne.
The Woman of Revelation CANNOT give BIRTH until the Head is in Position, ...which it is NOT. 
There will be yet another STILLBIRTH if the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws are not ABOLISHED.
The Woman/RCC will REMAIN the KILLER of the Saints until the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws are ABOLISHED,... which is the ONLY WAY to lift this Curse. 

As it is written so it shall be.
The fact that the Son of God was not created until those of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt were begotten by God's Spirit in 1420 BCE ...disproves the teachings of the Nicene Creed and the Roman Catholic Church regarding the Nature of God and His Son.
The next Great Reset that stands out took place with the Ecumenical Council of Nicea in 325 CE when they inculcated the two Good Shepherds they had MURDERED, Jesus and John, into their doctrine, bringing John's &amp; Jesus' followers into their Fold and DOGMA of DEATH... just as they
The problem lies in the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that DENY the existence of the True GOD, O, and His Laws of Love, Wisdom, and Understanding.... which are REQUIRED for PEACE. 
Let us pray our Viking brothers, the Saints, AWAKEN from their madness.
The self-determination of the Great Family of Kings, aka, Satan, has led them AWAY from the True God and THEIR own Creator, O. 
They need to ABANDON the madness embodied in the Nicene Creed that makes THEM God and their own "do as I say not as I do" laws... into the Laws of God.
The struggle within this Composite Man was between slavery &amp; freedom. Would he remain a slave to the Laws of Sin his Great Family or gain Mastery over them? 
The Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws had made him a slave. Would he have the Wisdom to ABOLISH this DOGMA when he came to Power?
The thing is, true Watchers don't want either side to die. In fact, the Watchers want BOTH SIDES to win,... but we know this CANNOT be accomplished with the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws in play.
Their own ways will come back upon their own heads. The House of Windsor pretends to be a friend of the world as they destroy it. Thus, the world THEY create will be destroyed by THEIR "friends". 
The ONLY WAY to avert this Fate is to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
Their psyche is riddled with peaks and valleys ....which it will continue to be until they ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. 

Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness.
There were only 3 men who, like Job, refused to "curse their own God and die" so they voted AGAINST the Nicene Creed. I have ZERO DOUBT that these three men were of the House of Von (Isaac) and were smart enough to realize that voting for that Creed was comparable to voting
These Kings are Jehovah, the God of Armies/War, the Adversary of the Prince of Peace, Jesus. 
Thus, Jesus was warning his followers to stay away from the TEACHINGS of the RCC which promotes the pagan dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws which were the teachings that caused
These men can make laws against pedophilia and homosexuality ...yet they themselves rape little boys and  GET AWAY WITH IT because the Nicene Creed makes THEM God and no one can judge God.... as he is the Final Authority on this planet.
They CANNOT receive a new name until they AWAKEN and lead mankind out of Death's grip. Rebirth. This rebirth will be triggered by the ABOLISHMENT of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. That Law Covenant with Death MUST be BROKEN before a New Covenant of Peace with O can begin.
They are recognized by the masses as LEGITIMATE because THEY have the BIRTH Certificate of Legitimacy,... the Nicene creed, to prove it. (Maybe they'll let you share theirs.) Are you the black sheep of THEIR Great Family? An UNDERLING born of a LESSER wife maybe?
They do not see themselves as others do and unfortunately have the power to run all over anyone who tells the emperor he "has no clothes." 
The House of Von is the naked Adam, the naked Emperor. Their nakedness is veiled with LIES/fig leaves,... the DOGMA of the Nicene Creed &amp;
They suffered to the Head thousands of years ago, thus understandable. (Long story). "My people are being destroyed because they DON'T KNOW ME." Hosea 4:6. (THIS is the reason the Vons need to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed which denies the existence of their God.)
This BELIEF flies in the face of the Nicene Creed, thus the creation of the "brother singled out" was an ABOMINATION in the eyes of his brothers and their God of War, because HIS very EXISTENCE MEANT the eventual LOSS OF their CONTROL over the lives of everyone.
This Oracle is telling the Merovingians/Vons that if they don't abolish the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws,... they will ABOLISH YOU. Your House will NOT SURVIVE the next century. 
You need to cut the days of World War III short,.... NOW, NOW, NOW!
This Serpentine Christ is spreading his poisonous armies across the planet so Death can continue its rule over the Dead from its Throne in Rome. 
ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws is the ONLY thing that can change this venomous serpent BACK into a harmless Garden Snake.
This Truth destroys the dogma of the Nicene Creed that both God and His Son were created at the same time and are both one and the same which is the dogma that emboldens the Sa Ra, Son of the Most High, who all kings claim to be (both the Most High and Christ) thus DENYING the
This can only be accomplished if they ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws. 

Let us pray our Viking brothers, the Saints, AWAKEN from their madness.
This drew John's/Jesus' followers into the very church of "holy ones" who had SLAUGHTERED their Shepherds because these "holy ones" of the Most High are the Killers of the Saints. 
They always have been &amp; they always will be until the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws are ABOLISHED
This explains why the Good Shepherd.... ie... offspring of the 18th Dynasty, Merovingians/Vons/Danes etc left the Serpent,..  but it does NOT explain WHY they created a Protestant Throne in the IMAGE of that SERPENT... based on the same dogma of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
This gave birth to the Nicene Creed which identifies Peter, NOT Jesus as the Sa Ra, Son of the Most High God,... once again sticking it up the ass of the House of Von who identify Biblically with Jesus, son of Joseph, who typifies Djoser/Imhotep.
This very issue contradicts the Nicene creed. In fact, the very EXISTENCE of the House of Von contradicts the Nicene Creed. What do you suppose the remedy for this will be? Invalidating the Creed which is the Foundation of the RCC or delegitimizing the House of Von/Merovingians
Those who constitute the Daughter of Babylon, the Vons, are going to be judged HARSHLY by the priests of the RCC and it is the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that will JUSTIFY their execution, which is the reason I continue suggesting that they ABOLISH this DOGMA before it happens.
Thus, Noah is a CONFLICTED man. He wants to do Good/Right,... but SABOTAGES himself... because he has lost his Vision/Favor and cannot find his way out of the Darkness. 

ABOLISHMENT of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws are MANDATORY for regaining Favor &amp; Rebirth.
Thus, when the House of Windsor/Danes/Vikings AWAKEN from Death and ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws they will once again become the Good Shepherd over this whole planet.
Let us pray our Viking Brothers AWAKEN from their madness ..as the world really needs them now.
Unfortunately for them, it is the Vons (Windsors) who are the true Target of this attack just as it was back then. 
When it is all over, Humpty Dumpty will take another Great Fall off his Wall of Babylon/Von if he doesn't embrace Wisdom and ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws.
Unlike Joan of Arc, a Von/Merovingian, who was later burned alive at the stake for basically this VERY SAME THING, these three men were BANISHED for failing to sign the Nicene Creed. These three men were basically the "log snatched out of the fire" of Hell.
We want them to CHANGE, which is the reason the Saints need to ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws... which will AFFECT this CHANGE.
What does their strike to the Serpent's Head entail? 
The ABOLISHMENT of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
The Serpent fears this more than anything because it means loss of slaves thus loss of Money and MONEY is its GOD.... it's POWER.
Where the Marriage License serves as nothing more than a Bill of Sale. Thus, the creators of the Mosaic Laws (Kings/Priests) were ADVERSARIES of the Creator which is demonstrated by their Nicene Creed dogma that identifies these Kings/Priests as "God" &amp; THEIR Laws as Laws of God.
While staring at CHECKMATE...  the Vons/Saints should ACCEPT the DRAW by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws... in recognition of the fact that THEY played the LOSING Game with Death...... and still got to walk away alive.
Your FALL is ALWAYS ORCHESTRATED from within your own Walls ....by those who sit at your own TABLE, ...men just as cunning as you are. 
Your DEATH lives WITHIN you, thus you need to clean out your own House by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
Your enemy is the Nicene Creed that says your God does not exist &amp; you are a heretic in need a slaughtering for believing he does. It's their way of saying the Vons are nothing &amp; will soon be reduced to the "dust" they were before O came along &amp; breathed life into their nostrils.
claiming that everything they had built was due to their own Right Hand indicating that they believed THEY were their own Creator ...in accord with a dogma of the Nicene Creed ....born from the MINDS of The ORDER/ONES WHO OUSTED the House of Von from Heaven, the RULING POSITION.
from the "work of their hands" &amp; all the evil that the Great Family, the Satan, has visited upon all humanity &amp; this planet with their dogma represented in the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws that gives this Great Family the Justification they need to DESTROY ALL LIFE on this planet.
ground which Jehovah (the God of War) has CURSED. (Genesis 5:29)
Michael is the one who erred when he gave his Power to the God of War and now he must TAKE that POWER BACK by ABOLISHING the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws.
how that ended for them. 
These Kings CANNOT lead mankind back into Paradise as long as they hold on to the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that constitute the Old Covenant, ....the SAME fig leaves they used to cover the asses of the 18th Dynasty/Flavians / House of Von, etc,... the
inside this LEVIATHAN. 
The 18th Dynasty/Vons/Merovingians etc have been HIDING their SHAME ever since because they refuse to admit their forefathers made a MISTAKE when they embraced the Mosaic Laws &amp; Nicene Creed that identifies the Warlock, Jehovah, as their God instead of O,
it WILL DO if the Good Shepherd does not AWAKEN and ABOLISH the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic Laws upon which this WICKED King/Priest System.... that DENIES the existence of his CREATOR,... is based.
need of CHANGE... i.e the ABOLISHMENT of the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws that CREATED this DEADLY CONSCIENCE, so they can pick up the Shepherd's Staff which they CANNOT DO... until the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws are thrown down.... resulting in Sword turned into PLOWSHARE.
on top as the Good Shepherd of this whole planet. A Good Shepherd doesn't need a machine gun or machete to keep his sheep in line. All he needs is his staff because the Good Shepherd does NOT RULE BY FEAR. Tyrants do, which is the reason THEY NEED the Nicene Creed &amp; Mosaic laws.
that rage toward Isaac/House of Windsor/Vons. I wish I could say the RCC would not be justified in their actions but I can't because they WILL be JUSTIFIED. The Windsors / Vons have one move. ONE. Either they ABOLISH the Nicene Creed and Mosaic Laws or they are doomed.
the Son of the Most High God, who is the ADVERSARY of O, ...the God who created the House of Von / Merovingians/Hoteps/Vikings, etc. from the 18th Dynasty of Egypt in the year 1420 BCE ...which identifies the Nicene Creed to be UNSOUND REASONING.
2/3
The picture he paints is of a Church faltering after the end of the Apostolic Age, decaying even in the Ante-Nicene period, and sliding into outright compromise and apostasy after Constantine to the point where even in the heyday of Patristics Mosheim tends to be negative.
@AStratelates Depends what you mean by monasticism.
If you mean standardised cenobitic (communal) monasticism, that began around the time of Nicea, and we have references to it in the various works of Athanasius, other early-mid 4th century Fathers, and later figures.
@AbrahamGL_1 I think we have to remember that this was not long after the Byzantine Papacy, and Nicea 2 was a majority Eastern Council in attendance.
This is important because the East and those connected to them were always more careful with regards to statuary because historical…
@AlFinlandi @BruvaLucius @CedarVirtue It’s easy to forget the church was conciliar long before Nicea inaugurated the age of ecumenical councils, and councils are in fact “nothing more than” the supreme expression of the mind of the church which exists without them but finds its most authoritative expression in them.
@AlFinlandi It’s important to note because even though we grant the pre-Nicene formulations weren’t as linguistically precise as later generations, extracts like this show sound understanding. Nicea and the post-Nicene Fathers weren’t making stuff up, as anti-Trinitarians claim.
@BenJamminRem @JeremyEpp7 @ByzCat The source on this instance is the Ante-Nicene Fathers collection, volume 5 for Hippolytus.
@Cal_Crucis @basedsauerkraut It was present among some of the late ante-Nicene Fathers but was a small minority.
John Chrysostom held the Sethite view and did a lot to popularise it in the East because he made the claim that the supernatural view is heretical.
@Cal_Crucis The proliferation of hymnody is a great example. 
There is clear evidence (contra the RPW) that non-scriptural hymns were already in use in the ante-Nicene period, though not in great quantity.
This gradually changed over the course of the 4th century and was accompanied by…
@CalebDixonSmith Not a viable reading of history; the veneration of saints and their relics was a key feature of Nicene Orthodoxy, part of the theology of the communion of the saints, and defended as standard Christian practice.
@CedarVirtue This is not the case.
Ephesus and Chalcedon styled themselves and were accepted immediately as ecumenical, as were Constantinople 2,3 and Nicea 2, despite some teething issues.
The notion that a council needs subsequent councils to ratify it is not the view of the councils.
@Cyprian258 The problem is that it’s wrong.
While some of the language of Nicea was not that of people like Justin, the theology is of that ancient heritage.
Even Homousios was not a brand new invention but rather a re-appropriation of an old term generally used by Sabellians.
@Cyprian258 The whole point of the arguments the Nicenes like Athanasius made was that the Trinitarian theology of Nicea was ancient, had been received from of old by the Fathers who had passed it down.
DBH is a heretical obfuscating modernist who is simply towing the line of liberals.
@EthanWayne2001 @JosephBenJ2 My mind immediately goes to Constantinople 553 which for a long time was ignored in official documentation in the west because of how neat it was to say “4 Gospels, 4 councils” viz Nicea to Chalcedon.
@EthanWayne2001 @NathaninSeoul @IanBurkePerry1 Deaconesses were not ordained as deacons are.
They were given the laying on of hands but that is not inherently a sacramental act of ordination akin to a deacon or priest.
Here are the relevant canons from Nicea and Laodicea: https://t.co/JdQl1JaiVS
@G00DP3RSON It didn’t, and the Fathers had no problem pointing to Nicea in the face of Arian councils.
None of the councils that banned icons were sound, either in terms of what they knew (as with Frankfurt), theologically and constitutionally (as with the robber council of Hieria),…
@G00DP3RSON Okay, I see where you’re coming from.
However the existence of other synods doesn’t contravene the ecumenical council any more than the fact that the Arians hold many of their own synods contravened the authority of Nicea.
@GawainICXC @SlavScottish The issue over Nicea 2 with the Franks is a complicated one.
It had a lot to do with misunderstandings of what the council was prescribing.
I did a long series of reply tweets on this that you might find helpful: https://t.co/LXqiItRfsF
@GeorgeNicholasK Indeed.
Relics and images and the theology behind them were present since the early centuries, growing in expression and maturity by the 4th and 8th centuries respectively.
Nicea 2 was just like the previous councils in responding to a controversy in a definitive way.
@GermanCarranza3 @Soulful76_Leaf Yes, in their proper context the quotes can be understood fine, the problem is that they’ve been lifted out of context and made to support what is in fact a donatist, pseudo-restorationist view, and the proposition of “going back to ante-Nicene times” is Protestant.
@GlowieOfTheYear @EastOfDenali @realKingpilled The Reformers did not break from “the Nicene canon of scripture.”
Scripture is declared scripture by God, by virtue of the fact that he inspired the books.
The Church then receives and recognises that which God has inspired.
@HappyHuguenot @OpStCyprian @Paisios_braden @superxtianmario Incorrect.
The theology of iconodulia is founded on scripture, and the use and veneration of images is to be found among the Fathers.
There is no positive command to call Jesus homoousios prior to Nicea.
@HappyHuguenot @OpStCyprian @Paisios_braden @superxtianmario It is, in fact, the same principle.
Homoosios is also a development of language and profession.
All the evidence shows no homoousios in the early church prior to Nicea.
Therefore, Nicea 1 errs.
Consistency.
@HappyHuguenot @OpStCyprian @Paisios_braden @superxtianmario Technically, homoousios was used prior to Nicea but that was by heretics, which makes the point even stronger.
@IanBurkePerry1 @TomsDigest Ceremonial veneration among the Latin school men of the 12th century was not the same as that of the medieval Byzantines of the same period.
They both accepted and followed Nicea 2, but there’s no question that they did so in their own ways.
@IanBurkePerry1 @TomsDigest Firstly, I would dispute that claim because Nicea 2 doesn’t specify the specific kinds of veneration to be paid to images, only that they are to be venerated, saluted, etc.
Veneration of imperial images is not a clear cut thing because Byzantine attitudes of the nature of…
@IanBurkePerry1 @punishedgnoll …full acceptance of Nicea 2.
In a word, I’d describe these Lutherans and Anglicans as inconsistent, both within their own traditions and among themselves.
Also, burning candles before and bowing to icons are particular expressions of veneration but not the only ways to do so.
@IanBurkePerry1 Relevant canons for the election of bishops are Canon 4, 6 and 15 of Nicea, Canon 23 of Antioch (341), Canon 1 and 6 of Sardica (343), Canon 12 and 23 (forbidding mobs from seditiously electing bishops by mere numbers) of Laodicea, Canon 13 of Carthage (390), and others.
@IconEnjoyer @KalebOfAtlanta @CalebDixonSmith No, the answer is no.
You could not outright reject the Trinity prior to Nicea and be orthodox, though you could have (by later standards) non-standardised views.
@JosephBenJ2 Also the theological work was nothing compared to what came after the council, and the Nicene resolution itself came in the same way as subsequent councils; through conciliar fiat upon adopting/adapting terminology.
@JosephBenJ2 Appeals to and arguments from scripture had actually failed at Nicea; Athanasius tells us that the Arians were winking and gesticulating at one another because they could agree to whatever scriptural formulation the council put forward since they’d simply reinterpret it.
@JosephBenJ2 However we do have a good amount of secondary literature from attendees describing the proceedings at Nicea, and they seem to have more or less been equivalent to those of later councils.
@JosephBenJ2 If you look at the history of the ecumenical councils, with the exception of Nicea 1, most of the exegetical/interpretive work to hash out the disputes was done in advance of the council.
With Constantinople 1, it was semi-Arianism, Eunomianism (über Arianism) and Macedonianism.
@JosephBenJ2 In terms of duration the Council of Nicea was basically on par with the other councils.
It was first opened on 20th May and most of the action was over once the creed was promulgated on 19th June, though proceedings technically continued until 25th August.
@JosephBenJ2 Nicea 1 was the exception because Arianism had been a mostly Egyptian affair before taking the church by storm.
A church that was just recovering from the worst persecution in its history.
Bishop Alexander of Alexandria had addressed Arianism in his jurisdiction…
@JosephBenJ2 There was definitely more in the way of direct hashing out of things at Nicea due to the factors I mentioned before.
This was the first time representatives from the entire church had gathered in one place, and the first time many had been exposed to Arian formulations.
@JosephBenJ2 This is why the Fathers at Nicea, when they realised the Arians could just reinterpret any scriptural formulations to for their theology, decided to use homoousios to describe the relationship of Father and Son in essence.
@JosephBenJ2 Unfortunately the minutes (written records of the sessions and acts) of Nicea and Constantinople 381 have been lost to history; the first ecumenical council for which the complete transcribed records survive is the Council of Ephesus.
@Low_Churchman @anglo_xian Effusive physical oriental expressions of veneration are approved, but they’re not the only way to show veneration.

Hypatius does not contradict Nicea 2, as I just explained.
@Low_Churchman @anglo_xian Except he isn’t, as I’ve established.
The basis upon which Nicea 2 defended veneration was the tradition of the church, which is not bound to or expressed in one form of veneration.
@Low_Churchman @anglo_xian This is not contrary to Nicea 2, and everyone who holds to that council can approve of what is said in this letter.
Just because more kinaesthetic expressions aren’t mentioned doesn’t mean veneration is opposed.
@Low_Churchman @anglo_xian To a degree yes, but the problem here is that you elevate personal judgement calls above their proper place.
I have not made a judgement call about Nicea in the way you have.
I recognise the council’s authority above my judgement whatever that may be, and I submit to it.
@Low_Churchman I’ve read the acts of Nicea 2.
That’s not the subject.
We’re talking about prayers to the saints which are consistently witnessed from the early centuries on.
If “gross acts of idolatry” were the norm in the church for a millennia, the kingdom was not advancing.
@MarkCarol887 @iamschuyler97 After the council Eusebius wrote a letter to his diocese describing what happened at Nicea, which can be found in the church histories of Socrates and Theodoret (NPNF Collection volumes  2 and 3 respectively) and was appended by Athanasius to his…
@MarkCarol887 @iamschuyler97 The NPNF collection itself has a lot of great stuff in volume 4 concerning Nicea. 
Henry Chadwick’s chapter on Nicea in “The Early Church” is good.
JND Kelly’s tome(highly recommended!) called “Early Christian Doctrines” has a chapter on “The Nicene Crisis” which excellent.
@MarkCarol887 @iamschuyler97 …Defence of the Nicene Definition (hence included in NPNF volume 4).
For an even more full contemporary description of the events at and theology of Nicea, see Athanasius aforementioned Defence of the Nicene Definition, from a man who was there as a deacon.
@MyJewishDonors @PalamismRspctr .::to make their decisions, but he did not speak through them in the same way he did through Paul.
No new revelation, but continuing inspiration nonetheless.
The Nicene Creed isn’t added to the canon, but accompanies it in the tradition of the church.
@MyJewishDonors @PalamismRspctr …textually reflective prophetic work that works within existing frameworks rather than presenting new revelation per say.
Kinda like the difference between the New Testament and the Nicene Creed; the Holy Spirit presided at the council and guided/inspired the Holy Fathers…
@OpStCyprian @Paisios_braden @superxtianmario Because St Justin Martyr’s formulation of the Trinity has the same maturity as that which came after Nicea.
Because no one before the 3rd century used the term homoousios it can’t be authentic.
@Rubatirabbit1 @Low_Churchman @anglo_xian I gave you exactly what you asked for.
Quotes from councils and fathers of the Nicene era fits the bill of early fathers.
Quoting Fathers before Nicea makes no sense because there hadn’t been any ecumenical councils prior to then.
@Rubatirabbit1 @Low_Churchman @anglo_xian I’m referring to the historicity grounded groups, be they Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Eastern Orthodox.
They all accept Nicea-3 Constantinople as ecumenical, with the Protestant groups placing special emphasis upon Nicea-Chalcedon.
@Rubatirabbit1 @Low_Churchman @anglo_xian There is no list, but rather a consistent witness.
Some examples coming up.

@Rubatirabbit1 @Low_Churchman @anglo_xian …and its adherence to what has been passed down.

@TheOtherPaul2 @casa_valera However he did clearly place Nicea on a league of its own.
In his Treatise on Baptism Against the Donatists, the same one which people go to for evidence of his high view of scripture, particularly to put it against the authority of councils, he says that…
@TheOtherPaul2 @casa_valera It is true that Augustine did not have a settled linguistic distinction between plenary/general and ecumenical councils.
This distinction was already current in other regions of the Church but not in Augustine’s mind.
He considered Arles and Sardica to be plenary alongside Nicea.
@TomsDigest Byzantine iconoclasm was put to rest permanently in 843, and the ecumenicity of Nicea 2 was reaffirmed by the Constantinopolitan councils of 869 and 879, which Rome was involved with.
After that, and with the exception of a few lingering Frankish dissenting voices…
@TomsDigest On this basis a few Frankish synods denounced Nicea 2, and an entire tome was written to repudiate the veneration of images under the assumption that veneration is not meaningfully distinct from divine adoration + that what the Byzantines and Italians were doing was adoration.
@TomsDigest Only then did the Greeks finally come to see it as on par with Nicea and Ephesus. 
Due to the Popes from Leo the Great onward taking issue with its canons being the first to elevate the See of Constantinople over Alexandria and Antioch, the West wasn’t uniform…
@TomsDigest Pope Adrian provided a refutation of some of the documents produced by the Franks, and later translations of Nicea 2 were careful to properly maintain the conciliar distinctions between veneration and adoration.
@TomsDigest Ratzinger was wrong.
Nicea 2 was an almost exclusively eastern affair because that’s where iconoclasm sprung up, but the west did receive it.
The Popes of the 8th century were politically isolated from the Byzantines but they were theologically aware of what was going on,…
@TomsDigest …have been aware of Nicea 2 for some time.
Nevertheless they used images, reliefs, and statuary.
Now, its official ecumenical status took time to be recognised, but this was also the case with Constantinople 381 which wasn’t received as ecumenical at all until Chalcedon.
@TomsDigest …in a shrinking minority, the acceptance of Nicea became a given wherever it was known.
I give that qualification only because it would appear that the far-flung realm of England, which was undergoing significant social and political turmoil (Vikings, etc), did not seem to…
@TomsDigest …than the more elaborate expressions of the Byzantines.
The Franks were the exception, holding to a position which was basically that of the later Lutherans; they did this in part because they had received a poor translation of the decrees of Nicea 2 which in places led them…
@TomsDigest …the orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, to mitigate the emperor’s influence.
Pope Adrian 1 wrote letters to Nicea 2 approving of iconophilia, and gave his signature to the council through his legates.
As far as the west (Rome in particular) was concerned, that was that.
@Wuyuxiang13 @anglo_xian @Low_Churchman That is incorrect; Hieria was a joke of a council.
It met none of the criteria to be an ecumenical council.
There are in fact standards whereby Nicea 2 is accepted over Hieria.
Namely, an ecumenical council must by duly called, and representative of the whole church…

@Wuyuxiang13 @anglo_xian As for the specific claims you highlighted, first of all it is not true that in the West Nicea 2 “only came into view in the era of the Reformation.”
Just a heads up, the following is going to be a lot of text, and will be my final response before I go for my afternoon shift.
@Wuyuxiang13 @anglo_xian Nicea 2 was an almost exclusively eastern affair because that’s where iconoclasm sprung up, but the west did receive it.

@Wuyuxiang13 @anglo_xian The Franks/Germans/Gallicans (at least most of them) did indeed initially reject Nicea 2, in part because they had received a poor translation of the decrees of Nicea 2 which in places led them to believe that divine worship had been allowed and mandated for images,…
@Wuyuxiang13 @anglo_xian There were also some Frankish clergy and theologians who did accept Nicea 2.
But Byzantine iconoclasm was put to rest permanently in 843, and the ecumenicity of Nicea 2 was reaffirmed by the Constantinopolitan councils of 869 and 879, which Rome was involved with.

There’s no question the medieval west accepted Nicea 2.
@_matthewpearson The Apocalypse of Peter is an important early textual witness for many traditional Christians interpretations, especially on hell, but it has never been considered sacred scripture or canonical except by a few isolated groups in the ante-Nicene period.
@anglo_xian @Athanasius33 Ah okay, my mistake.
The answer is that the Christian position prior to Nicea 2 involved the theology and veneration of icons.
Not everyone had the same understanding and practiced in the same way.
Likewise with Nicea 1.
@anglo_xian @Athanasius33 Regarding with reverence is one way of showing veneration
Bowing is another.
Nicea 2 condemned those that refuse to venerate icons, and did so in the context of oriental forms of veneration.
The church has the authority to respond to heresy by decreeing what is and isn’t correct.
@anglo_xian @Athanasius33 Shall we suggest that those who didn’t have the exact Nicene understanding of the Son’s consubstantiality with the Father were not Christians?
No.
Some did; some has anticipated the council more clearly in their formulations, while others had not.
So it is with Nicea 2.
@anglo_xian @Athanasius33 You have seen the evidence provided in previous discussions that people before Nicea 2 did in fact venerate icons.
The council was not called for nothing.
The iconoclast controversy was a thing.
People were prohibiting the veneration of icons and were actively destroying them,…
@buzz_commander Eustathius is far too late and prominent I’m afraid.
The figure I’m speaking of was firmly ante-Nicene, around during the formative time of monasticism.
@buzz_commander Nah he’s quite a prominent figure.
The man who was spoken of in the book I’m thinking about was *very* obscure, an seemingly inconsequential figure who lived prior to Nicea.
@casa_valera Nevertheless, Augustine and his countrymen in Africa show firm dedication toward Nicea, which was at the time the only recognised ecumenical council which everyone knew to be so.
They definitely considered it above even authoritative plenary councils like Arles and Sardica.
@decafcatholic @barukalas @john_law_3 Unwillingness to act on such important matters only means it will get worse.
Cancers must be cut out as soon as possible.
It’s easy to forget that the time between when Arius began preaching his heresy and the calling of Nicea was a decade or less.
@jhunter46 @BirminghamScot2 @aprilajoyr The council of Nicea had absolutely nothing to do with the canon of scripture.
That’s a myth which began in the 18th century and popularised in modern times by crackpot books.
@matthaschanged @anglo_xian @OccidentalOrtho @superxtianmario Aquinas was wrong, using unfortunate and inaccurate language that is not in line with the terminology of Nicea 2, but he did not worship the material of images or crosses.
In his language, wrong though it is, latria (divine worship) is offered to Christ through the image.
@mokimokomoku Re Nicea 2, that’s your opinion of it, and which doesn’t even deal with the historical and doctrinal continuity of that council with what came before, but you’re entitled to your view.
@potamopotos @casa_valera Because Augustine did not have a linguistic distinction between plenary and ecumenical councils, he called Arles Sardica and Nicea plenary but held Nicea above the others (1) and said that the universal consensus of the church is above plenary councils. (2)
@potamopotos @casa_valera Even Rome, the East, and ancient fathers who believed Nicea to be infallible understood that conciliar canons, particularly those of a disciplinary nature, can be subject to contextualisation, change, or being ignored if necessary.
@potamopotos @casa_valera For example, the Nicene canons (and many others from early councils) forbid the bishop of one see to move to another.
This is one of the most important disciplinary canons ever produced and remains relevant and upheld to this day.
@potamopotos @casa_valera Incorrect.
He talks about plenary/general councils; unlike many of his contemporaries Augustine did not have a linguistic distinction between plenary and ecumenical councils.
Arles and Sardica were plenary to him, as was Nicea, and yet from his writings…
@potamopotos @casa_valera Plenary councils are lesser, though as I said Augustine did not have a fully formed linguistic repertoire to express this. 
He undoubtedly saw Arles, Sardica and Nicea as plenary.
What I’m saying is that along with his associates he recognised that Nicea was above the rest.
@potamopotos @casa_valera Sardica, which he considered plenary as well as Arles, had bishops from “the whole Christian world” yet is not ecumenical and not of the same status as Nicea in the mind of Augustine and his fellow African bishops.
@potamopotos @casa_valera What I’m saying is that despite his linguistic shortcoming here he viewed Nicea above “mere” plenary councils.
I already explained his quote about local and plenary councils, including how “of the whole Christian world” fits in this framework.
@potamopotos @casa_valera …and those of the councils in North Africa, he and his associates were willing if necessary to let go of the canons and decisions of those former councils, but not so with Nicea.
It is plain even from attendance alone that Arles did not have equivalent authority with Nicea.
@potamopotos @casa_valera …from all over the Christian world, was also considered to be plenary by Augustine.
Yet he held Nicea above even these as is evident from his treatment of it in his writings and those of the African synods.
@potamopotos @casa_valera …of scripture and try to formulate a case for putting this against ecumenical councils; his treatise on Baptism Against the Donatists.
Augustine and his associates in Africa view Nicea differently than they did Arles and Sardica, as is evidenced from how they view it…
@potamopotos I didn’t say that it mentioned Nicea, I was pointing out what it says about the universal consensus of the church. https://t.co/dCxzPhhFD2
@testing521 Pastor Jim survives Constantine’s persecution and gatecrashes the Council of Nicea, KJV in hand, for an epic showdown with the emperor’s lackey bishops.
The Holy Ghost descendeth upon him, and the Greek speakers understand his Elizabethan English.
They repent bitterly.
@wandlearner @decafcatholic @barukalas @john_law_3 But more to the point, the official ecclesiastical action against Arianism was swift and theologically decisive with Nicea.
There is nothing to my knowledge even approaching that with the current problems in the ACNA.
The situations are not comparable.
@wandlearner @decafcatholic @barukalas @john_law_3 The Homoiousians of the east were increasingly trending towards Athanasius, splintering and weakening, while strict Arianism was dying out.
With regards to Arianism proper, Constantinople 381 was simply an affirmation of Nicea and its formalised confirmation in the east.
@wandlearner @decafcatholic @barukalas @john_law_3 We can hardly refer to the persistence of Arianism among the Goths as a mark against the success of the orthodox position per Nicea, for they were outside the regularly reaches of orthodox activity and missions, and aside from their political significance…
@wandlearner @decafcatholic @barukalas @john_law_3 …the faith of the church.
The political ascendancy of Arianism was effectively over by 365.
Conservative Old Nicene orthodoxy won out over a compromise position in 357-359, and they increasingly came to agreements with the more cautious New Nicenes.
An excellent reply thread explaining the grounds for the claims of the Council Fathers at Nicea 2 that iconodulia is apostolic and the ancient tradition of the church. https://t.co/jtW1n5U9jY
Contrary to some claims, the “extravagant” aspects of the veneration of saints go back to the time before Nicea.
A great example is found in Eusebius’ “Martyrs of Palestine”, written in 311 prior to the end of Roman Persecution of Christians.
I affirm every clause of the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, and the doctrines contained therein, as received from the Holy Fathers of the Ecumenical Councils, as they’re intended to be understood.
I also subscribe to the conciliar canons as interpreted + used through the ages.
Nicene Orthodoxy was characterised by the veneration of saints in its many forms.
Reading the primary sources and scholarly appraisals of the material makes this crystal clear.
Even the diminishing pagan thinkers point this out (with disdain, I might add).
One of the ancient traditions of the church which is not only profoundly meaningful but also convinced me of the validity of apostolic tradition is the Sign of the Cross.
It is ubiquitous in the post-Nicene patristic age, and goes back into the primitive church.
“Whoever shall presume to set aside the decree of the Holy and Great synod which assembled at Nicea in the presence of the pious Emperor Constantine, beloved of God,…let them by excommunicated and cast out of the church.”
-Canon 1 of the Council of Antioch 341
…myself pure for you, O Bridegroom, and holding a lighted torch I go to meet you.’”
-A hymn in Methodius of Olympus’ Treatise on Chastity, written circa 270-290 AD.

Of note; the high mariology, the implication of liturgical devotion to Mary in the ante-Nicene period,…
…the Council of Ephesus, he says that the Symbol of the Faith (creed) of Nicea was “set out some time ago by the Holy Ghost at the great and holy synod convened in Nicea.”
Later in the same letter, immediately after reciting the Nicene Creed, he says that…
@2007Cowalker @APEInvestor9 @Askwhyisit The Bible doesn't claim Church as the authority. It claims Jesus and His teachings as the authority. Church purpose is to worship Jesus and faithfully propagate His teachings. On the basis of agreement concerning the Nicene Creed interpretation, our diversity is strength.
@2007Cowalker @Askwhyisit On matters of faith and salvation, nearly all Christian denominations accept the Nicene Creed as a summary and basis for belief and cooperation on common projects e.g. Bible translation. The Bible is reconcilable with other history of the region and period covered. 1/2
@2007Cowalker @Askwhyisit The existence and claims of other religions' texts not accepted by Nicene Christianity (Koran, Book of Mormon) is a matter for believers in those other faiths. 2/2
@Askwhyisit Bible translation into different languages made some mistranslations and differences of understanding inevitable. The wide acceptance of the Nicene Creed and better scholarship has largely resolved these issues. There's also much diversity of expression which can be celebrated.
@Askwhyisit The Church works now better, as it did in the early days,  as a chaord, not as a hierarchy. Under persecution it had no other choice. The fact of denominations all accepting the Nicene creed cooperating on the ground on many joint missions, is a strength and not a weakness. 1/2
@Askwhyisit The fact is that the major trinitarian denominations agree on the Nicene Creed, and where I live work together on ecumenical grass-roots initiatives e.g. concerned with Foodbanks, children's work and Bible translation. 2/2
@BaxterWilliams_ That kind of god doesn't seem to correspond to the relational God I feel I relate to as informed by the New Testament and Nicene Creed. If that's how you feel you've been taught, I think you've either been taught wrong or got what you were imperfectly taught wrong.
@Briyian23 Mormons might reasonably be considered Christians by Nicene Christians, when they reject Joseph Smith and his writings as the crook, philanderer, predator and conman he was, and accept the Nicene Creed.

https://t.co/AFc3EFCv22
@CapturingChrist C.S.Lewis' "Mere Christianity" argues for a Nicene faith accepted by all major trinitarian denominations. United we stand - and it's this faith that unites us. If disunited over side issues, the world won't see truth in what we do or in who we are, see Mark 9:38-40.
@Glaceglacier Doesn't matter which Trinitarian denomination for me so long as Nicene Creed compliant, walks the talk, and doesn't preach or support politics antithetical to the gospel. Not worth throwing out the baby Jesus with the denominational bathwater concerning dry pedantic differences.
@GodlessApeMan @Askwhyisit Pretty much all Orthodox, Roman Catholic &amp; Protestant denominations agree on the Nicene Creed. The fact we work together in most places on things that matter to us, e.g. Foodbanks, Bible translation, says more than the diminishing areas where sectarian differences still apply.
@GodlessApeMan @Askwhyisit The crucifixion is considered by all Nicene Christians as a horrific event - with a joyful consequence. We symbolically partake in this and remember it whenever we share communion of bread and wine to remember the body and blood.
@GodlessApeMan @Underwoodforyou An interesting story concerning the Nicene Creed is linked below. St Nicholas in Italian was the original 'Santa Claus'. Arians today (Jehovah's Witnesses) still don't celebrate Christmas. 2/2 https://t.co/fGlS8YA2TW
@GodlessApeMan @Underwoodforyou As one who considers the New Testament as written by humans who had mostly first or 2nd hand knowledge of Christ's teachings and was God inspired, I'm comfortable with the Nicene Creed interpretation. If you want to find someone who isn't ask a Jehovah's Witness or Gnostic.
@GodlessApeMan @Underwoodforyou I think that's fair comment in relation to the faithful and effective dissemination of Christ's teachings. The work of Bible translation is a crucial part of this need and with languages changing, will never be completely finished.  The Nicene Creed is a most successful meme.
@GodlessApeMan @Underwoodforyou The early church had to deal with divisions resulting from heresies and differences of interpretation. One problem group was the Gnostics, whom I consider the Scientologists of the day. Another was the Arians - with the Nicene Creed clarifying mainstream Trinitarian belief. 1/2
@GodlessApeMan @shane_pruitt78 I believe the Biblical interpretation summary as represented by the Nicene Creed is the closest to what God wants us to believe about Him we're likely to achieve and understand this side of a second coming.
@GodlessApeMan @shane_pruitt78 My reading and understanding of the Bible is consistent with the Nicene Creed. It took much thought and discussion by the great theologians of the time to arrive at this compromise text. It specifically rejected the Arian heresy which I also consider morally deficient.
@Jack_Cleveland_ The God of the Christian Nicene Creed distinguishes Himself from the rest by being relational, demonstrated through the incarnation and resurrection. Why would you expect the author of the laws of nature to be subject to these laws otherwise, or further than as the NT reveals ?
@KellyPearsall3 These matters all substantively agreed between Trinitarian churches (Catholic, Orthodox and most Protestants) accepting the Nicene Creed. I'm too busy for "how many angels dance on a pin" kinds of distinction. Coventry UK churches are united in being good news to the poor.
@TJamesAllen @exilefromgroggs My parents brought me and siblings up in the Roman Catholic tradition. As an adult I found faith within a lively Evangelical church where I've stayed and support on account of work for local disadvantaged. Theologically I classify myself as a Nicene Creed more liberal believer.
@TheEmpire49 @don_bedsole Shall we start with what saves us and Paul's milk, before we get onto the meat ? The Nicene Creed summarises the starting point quite well in my view. 
See 1 Corinthians 3:2  .
@TheEmpire49 @don_bedsole The scriptures as a whole are wonderful and enlightening  and contain a detailed description of God's purposes for our salvation - and are more easily taken out of context and misinterpreted than the Nicene Creed. Teaching the latter faithfully is easier as it's much shorter.
@TheEmpire49 All who accept the Nicene Creed, which includes Roman Catholics, Orthodox and most Protestant denominations have very similar beliefs in relation to Christ's teaching. Mark 9:38-41 very obviously applies.
@TheIdealistic1 I believe in the God of New Testament Christianity as summarised by the Nicene Creed, which is accepted by most Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant denominations.
@TheIdealistic1 Nearly all Christians agree with the Nicene Creed. There are some other differences, but these don't seem very important in comparison with what we're agreed about.
@Trent_Horn @costiwhinn If Jesus was telling the truth with Mark 9:38-41, challenging the genuineness of his followers on the basis of different denomination or tradition seems bigoted and sectarian. The Nicene Creed seems a more relevant criteria concerning whether refusers are undermining the Gospel.
@VudatNation Brought up Catholic, the liturgy in English could then be understood. Other good reforms in Vatican 2 - in the sense I don't consider my part of the friendly and wider Nicene Christian communion still 'protestant' in the sense of protesting about what this council achieved.
@WilliamMcgibney @ingersoll_bob Nearly all Christian denominations accept the Nicene Creed. https://t.co/UOoVHSN99F
@catholicsede15 @JoRo_______ Thanks @catholicsede15 . I'm a Nicene Creed believing Christian. Happy to work for Trinitiarian Christian unity in any chaordic leadership context. From that perspective having a diversity of Nicene Christianity denominations is a strength not a weakness.

@don_bedsole @TheEmpire49 It doesn't cover how many angels dance on a pin. And that doesn't matter. It's God who does the saving. Not a formulation of doctrine decided by men. The Nicene Creed enables those who accept it to know and relate to the God who saves us.
@jakelangford @SecularOutpost Nicea just rubber stamped what the Church had already agreed concerning the canon while expelling the Arian heresy and writing the creed uniting all trinitarians who accept it and which clarified the matter. https://t.co/epUeLZ8UbZ
@lyskitsune @Askwhyisit Attempts to impose a revisionist understanding of the canon upon the C4th Church would have resulted in a Holy war, for which there is no historical evidence. You therefore evidently misunderstand by misrepresenting Constantine's role. Nicea formalised what was agreed earlier.
@lyskitsune @Askwhyisit You might learn something, perhaps enabling you to appear less obviously ill informed in public discourse, by studying references made by pre Nicene church fathers to the NT canon. To make it easier for you I've linked a table. https://t.co/r9k2EuYWGx
@rantyskeptic @AVoice12456423 @TJamesAllen We don't need to take all these footnotes nearly as seriously as the texts themselves, and for these denominational reasons. The interpretation where nearly all denominations came into agreement and have remained in agreement is the Nicene Creed.
@rantyskeptic @AtheistIntelli2 The very human means of communication which the incarnation involved, means we shouldn't get too hung up on the minor points of confusion e.g. which led to denominations which have agreed the Nicene Creed disagreeing on relatively unimportant side issues.
@spikeinthemidge @Askwhyisit Nicene Creed Christianity views God as 3 persons. I sometimes think of the Holy Spirit as feminine, but maybe it's just me that does.
@Acolyte83349490 @Hunt_w2021 @potamopotos There were inspired Apostles in Acts 15. Not at Nicea. A layman can reject anything. Doesn't mean he is correct. Nicea isn't true because some bishops said so. I'm not EO or Rome. The confession of Nicea is an accurate explanation of Scripture. That's why it's correct.
@Acolyte83349490 @Hunt_w2021 @potamopotos Where before Nicea do we have an extensive presentation on what would make for an authentic ecumenical council? Even better, where do the Apostles give that criteria?
@Acolyte83349490 @Hunt_w2021 @potamopotos You have artificially limited the "judgment of the church" to a select few ecumenical councils, so this isn't very impressive. You even do this after the fact. Nobody went into Nicea thinking, "All right guys, the church is about to infallibly define things for all time."
@Acolyte83349490 @Hunt_w2021 @potamopotos Your selection is arbitrary and depends largely on imperial support. My doctrine of providence as a Calvinist can handle that without having to claim infallibility. Yours really can't. Constantine was a layman who participated at Nicea.
@Carolus7777 @matthewpao1 @Kenneedsgrace @OpStCyprian @OllamFodhla @brokenbose That's like saying no one taught "same essence" before Nicea said "homoousios." Both Prots and RCs can legitimately claim continuity with the pre-Reformation Western tradition. That's one reason why "tradition" can't settle which body is actually teaching Apostolic doctrine.
@KalaDeeDee @GeorgeNicholasK @archisoteric @barkersburley So what matters isn't unanimous history but unanimity at councils? Arian bishops didn't care much for Nicea. And they almost recaptured the church. If they had, would that have made Arianism true?
@KalaDeeDee @archisoteric @barkersburley The church doesn't speak with "one voice" on the issue until Nicea II, and even then it is debatable since anti-image traditions among some continued at least in the West. And, since many fathers did not affirm image veneration, it isn't the patristic consensus.
@KalaDeeDee @barkersburley @archisoteric *Some* church fathers supported the use of icons. Not all. That's my point. There's no consensus. I know some did. Some did not. No unanimity. At best, by Nicea II and its aftermath, you have something resembling a majority view. But truth isn't determined by counting noses.
@VivaCristoRey73 @Agathon_B There had in fact been two ecumenical councils by the time Augustine died, Nicea and Constantinople I. Plenary means "full," and if an ecumenical council doesn't qualify as a "full" council that can be corrected if necessary, I don't know what does.
@barob05 @OpStCyprian @TheOtherPaul2 @Reformed_Dweeb @matthewpao1 If you don't have to interpret it according to its original intent, the teaching can be reformed or outright changed. Infallibility, again, is adding nothing. Nothing could stop you from reinterpreting Nicea, for instance. If Muslims are saved, it's really already been done.
@barob05 @Reformed_Dweeb @matthewpao1 @TheOtherPaul2 @VirtueApplied "Homoousios" is a word used to make clear what Scripture teaches when the church confronted a heresy—Arianism—the Apostles didn't face. But of course before Nicea, people believed what homoousios signifies. The NT testifies that the Apostles did.
@barob05 @Reformed_Dweeb @matthewpao1 @TheOtherPaul2 @VirtueApplied Great. Therefore, they taught what Nicea taught about homoousious without using the actual word. Nothing anachronistic then.
@barob05 @Reformed_Dweeb @matthewpao1 @TheOtherPaul2 @VirtueApplied It's beyond question that the Nicene Fathers believed that the Apostles taught what they were using the word homoousios to describe. Anatolios, for instance, makes this plain in his work on Nicea, and he's not even a Protestant.
@barob05 @Reformed_Dweeb @matthewpao1 @TheOtherPaul2 @VirtueApplied So the Apostles didn't believe or teach that Jesus and the Father are of the same substance? The Nicene Fathers explicitly argue otherwise.
@barob05 @matthewpao1 @OpStCyprian @orthodox_luke @themonkylad I infer it from you citing people saying "don't read Nicene ontological categories" into the text. Well sure, don't do that if they don't come from the text. My point is that they actually do come from the text.
@barob05 @matthewpao1 @OpStCyprian @orthodox_luke @themonkylad I've read some of Bauckham on this. He says that the Apostles left behind an oral tradition containing information not found in the NT that formed the basis for Nicaea? I don't remember that.
@barob05 @matthewpao1 @OpStCyprian @orthodox_luke @themonkylad On what? Nicea?
@barob05 @matthewpao1 @OpStCyprian @orthodox_luke @themonkylad The concepts taught at Nicaea are from the Bible, not from some mythical extrabiblical oral tradition. Nicaea just happens to be the best summary of those concepts that no one has yet surpassed.
@barob05 @matthewpao1 Actually, as Anatolios, an EO points out, Nicea defined the Trinity based on Scripture, but it saw the photo-Nicene, anti-Arian tradition as a reliable guide to understanding Scripture. And that because they believed it came from the Apostles.
@barob05 Did the Apostles teach the substance of the Nicene doctrine or not? Athanasius and the Cappadocians, to name but a few, sure thought they did.
@barob05 Honestly not trying to be combative here, but this is important. If the Apostles teach homoousios implicitly, they teach the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity. It's implicit, but it is their teaching. That is what those who follow Nicea have always confessed.
@barob05 IOW, Homoousios is useful shorthand; the best we've come up with. But if someone teaches "same nature" without using the word, one is teaching the same doctrine that Nicea teaches. What matters is the concept.
@barob05 In using "homoousios," Nicea did not believe they were teaching anything new. All they were doing was articulating in a new context what the Apostles had taught. The Nicene doctrine of the Trinity is but a rearticulation of what the Apostles taught in response to new challenges.
@barob05 Limit it to the Nicene Fathers settlement. You seem to be arguing against them when you say that the Apostles did not teach Nicene doctrine. The only reason to affirm Nicene doctrine is if the Apostles taught it. The Nicene Fathers agreed that the Apostles taught Nicene doctrine
@barob05 Not exactly. Because Witherington and Webster don't believe in an infallible church that you have to follow even when the exegesis is bad. I don't deny that the church has grown in its understanding. But that's different than saying "the Apostles don't teach Nicene doctrine."
@barob05 Ok, then we don't disagree here. The Apostles teach the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity. To be sure it is implicit, requiring theological reflection. But everything necessary for the Nicene doctrine is found in the actual words of the Apostles.
@barob05 So the Church Fathers were wrong, then, to believe that the Apostles teach Nicene doctrine? That's a pretty astounding claim on your part given that the fathers are supposed to be an authority for you in a way they aren't for Protestants.
@barob05 To add to the faith is to believe something that Apostles don't teach explicitly or implicitly. Honestly, I've never had a RC so brazenly admit that the Apostles don't teach the Nicene faith even implicitly.
@barob05 Why? Because the Apostles are the authoritative representatives of Christ.

The faith isn't the same if they don't teach Nicene doctrine even implicitly. That makes Nicea an addition, not a development of understanding.
@barob05 You don't have to be able to articulate doctrine precisely the same way to hold to the same concept. This is why Nicea can claim that at least some earlier fathers who used homoiousios taught the same concept as Nicea.  Nicea simply adds helpful precision. It isn't a new thing.
@barob05 You said they don't teach the Nicene doctrine even implicitly. Something has to be present at least implicitly in the Apostles for it to be the same faith as the Apostles. Otherwise "same" is meaningless.
@brokenbose @matthewpao1 @OpStCyprian @wcgrimley @Kenneedsgrace @Carolus7777 @TaylorRMarshall @dlongenecker1 There were no Tridentine Roman Catholics either. You don't have the exact same beliefs as Nicea, or Irenaeus, or anyone else.
@conciliumMDXLV @SAHNHAH @MilitantThomist No he doesn't. Nicea 2 isn't representative of the universal church anyway. Disputes over images go back to the beginning and continued after, with much unease of them. Regardless, you don't need to affirm Nicea 2 in order to affirm Nicea 1 or any other council.
@matthewpao1 @Reformed_Dweeb You can't say, "Bodily Assumption isn't a complete innovation even though it isn't mentioned until after Nicea because logic and then say perseverance is an innovation because it's not mentioned before Calvin." I don't do double standards.
@matthewpao1 @orthodox_luke @barob05 @OpStCyprian @themonkylad Nope. If we did, we wouldn't affirm the Nicene Creed, among other things. We believe that over time the church fell into significant error, not that the faith or church ever totally disappeared.
@matthewpao1 Be consistent, then, and reject the Immaculate Conception and the Bodily Assumption. No record of Bodily Assumption before Nicea. Why is that fine but perservance not?
@ngmi_ngmi @MegasAlxandros @workswithseed The belief that the councils were infallible is a later belief developed over centuries, only after the councils were being held and supported by the emperor, not something the church starts out with, and nothing that anyone thought going into Nicea, for example.
@ngmi_ngmi @MegasAlxandros @workswithseed The very earliest church is described in the New Testament. Everything else is downstream from that. Some of it is good, some not. But Nicea isn't the earliest church, for instance. That doesn't make it automatically right or wrong. It has to be evaluated by the Apostolic Word.
@ngmi_ngmi @Ramanthos @MegasAlxandros @workswithseed Churches with religious art does not equal the iconodule view. You also have writings against images long before Nicea 2, so there was disagreement And a lack of controversy just means lack of controversy. It says nothing about whether the practice is right or wrong.
@orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 @barob05 @OpStCyprian @themonkylad Depends on what they got wrong. If Nicea got its creed wrong, then later councils were wrong to reaffirm it. But the creed wasn't the only thing done at Nicea. Ergo, the council could get a creed wrong but mess up elsewhere. AFAIK, nobody follows every canon of every council. 1/2
@orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 @barob05 @OpStCyprian @themonkylad IOW, Nicea could get homoousios right and something else wrong. There's no guarantee that a council will get everything right. No one went into Nicea thinking, "All right guys, we're about to be infallible on everything."
@orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 @barob05 @OpStCyprian @themonkylad Who says the councils all erred? Not me. Not Luther. Not Calvin. You take it on a council by council basis. You even take it on a decree by decree basis. Nothing says Nicea couldn't get some things right and some things wrong, for instance.
Sola Scriptura as a methodological principle in theology assumes that the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed and Chalcedonian Definition rightly understand Scripture. If you deny the Trinity or the hypostatic union, you aren't actually practicing sola Scriptura.
@1Zeropride @NathanS89095477 @EricRSammons Except, it does not say latria which is worship, but proskynesis which is permitted by Nicaea II.
@Agathon_B @potamopotos What I was trying to get at, is that both of us are disagreeing with St Augustine on that specific point. (I presume) Imo, it comes down to what is the catholic faith. And my answer would be, Apostle's Creed &amp; Nicene Creed &amp; Quicumque Vult.
@Agathon_B Hm ? Aquinas says that icons of Christ are to be given not only dulia, but even latria, and  Nicaea II condemns all who refuse to venerate icons.
@Agathon_B I'm not saying that Adrian supported Charlemagne, but that the council of Nicea II was not ratified by any pope until 880 AD, and until then, not recognized by popes as an ecumenical council (Which poses serious problems for Vatican 1 ecclesiology)
@Agathon_B It was a council called by Emperor Bl. Charlemagne, to repudiate &amp; condemn Nicaea II. Of course, that was not the only time Nic. II was rejected, here's Pusey on the topic, cf: The Articles Treated on in Tract 90 Reconsidered and Their Interpretation by Edward Pusey https://t.co/B8yVakB1PD
@BillyG35908955 @TaylorRMarshall @BruceWatson43 And while you do not admit that you can render ἐλάτρευσεν to anyone but God alone (except thomists who even render latria to the crucifix), Nicaea II permits προσκυνῶμεν to the saints, etc....
2/
@BillyG35908955 @TaylorRMarshall @BruceWatson43 So you see, that Scripture forbids that which Nicaea II permits. Besides, the fact that the saints pray for you, does not warrant that you pray to them. So from whence do you think that you can pray to them ? 
4/
@ChiengrisUltime So before Nicaea I, the Church allows theological discussion on the divinity of Christ? (within due limit of course!!!)

Right? Right?
@Doomercath A simple refutation of popish devilry: 
1. Apostolic Canons ratified by Nicaea II states that the Pope cannot do stuff without the consent of all.
2. John VIII utterly condemned and annulled Constantinople IV, and later the popish caesars regarded it as general council, still do
@JohannduToit11 @InquiringAJ @ByzCat There is nothing wrong with the adoration of Christ, and everything is wrong with the adoration of images.
Nicaea II condemn such paganism, Aquinas teach it.
@OrthodoxChrist2 @PalamismRspctr @TheOtherPaul2 @WesternProdigy Yeah. One of you fellas' better apologist, Ubi uses his works many times. He's an honest scholar (and catholic priest so he too accept Nicaea II)
@PalamismRspctr @OrthodoxChrist2 @TheOtherPaul2 @WesternProdigy Again, if you argue that Nicaea II was received universally, that is false, it was never received universally. Which then drive one to ask, on what basis do you accept Nicaea II but not Florence ? 
It's all a fable
@PalamismRspctr @TheOtherPaul2 @WesternProdigy Elvira was upheld by Chalcedon, and Elvira in canon 36 forbids even the making of images. Do you uphold that, and if so, why do you accept Nicaea II?
@PalamismRspctr @TheOtherPaul2 @WesternProdigy Furthermore, Nicaea II also had the absence of the Pentarchy. Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem were neither informed of the convocation of the Council, nor represented at it by official legates (See Price). Western bishops were not even invited.
@PalamismRspctr @TheOtherPaul2 @WesternProdigy Well, if you don't have to uphold "every aspect or act" of a council, then how does that differ from say, rejecting iconodulia of Nicaea II?
It wasn't even known in the East, and the West condemned it so calling it ecumenical is a bit stretch imo. Florence would be one aswell..
@PopeSaintPiusX The Council of Carthage pronounces the anathema against such nonsense as theistic evolution, which was accepted by Trullo, which was accepted by Nicea II.
@Ramanthos @KnoxiteTheocrat @MallardReborn I would agree that burning incense can be, in a religious sense offered only to God. But Nicaea II says something else: 
"Further, people are drawn to honour these images with the offering of incense and lights, as was piously established by ancient custom"
...
@Ramanthos @MallardReborn @KnoxiteTheocrat Which is the very defense for iconodulia, later espoused by some Fathers and Nicaea II. And which defense of Celsus, was rejected by Origen for example. ( He was a heretic, sure but still a historical witness )
@TomsDigest @MWauck @NeilNPNW Constantinople IV is one of my favourites. The acceptance of Trullo in full (even the anti roman canons) by Hadrian I and by Nicaea II is also top notch
@agusofpare @AhhhhhSchmidt @MilitantThomist @Reformed_Dweeb 6. Nicaea II oblige you to offer sacrifice to her images, and the images of Saints and of Christ, such as incense. If you reject that, Nicaea II anathematizes you.

So again, who are you trying to fool like a wicked serpent?
@apoc_12 @standev9 Exactly, Nicaea II is very clear: "Certainly this is not the full adoration {latria} in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature"

Aquinas says the opposite however, in ST Tertia Pars Q25, Articles 3,4.
@g_mancz "We gladly embrace the Divine Canons, viz.: those of the Holy Apostles, of the Six Ecumenical Synods, as also of the local synods and of our Holy Fathers, as inspired by one and the same Holy Spirit."

- Nicaea II
@g_mancz It is not merely the ratification of Rome which is needed for the council to be ecumenical. But Patriarchs too. Otherwise, Nicaea II's reasoning for Hieria not being ecumenical makes no sense at all. It would be then enough to cite Rome, and omit Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem https://t.co/gEeHhp7HbD
@g_mancz Jerusalem was an Apostolic Council. Nicaea was the first ecumenical.
@g_mancz Nice myth, but as ridiculous as the papal forgeries or the  myth about John VIII excommunicating St Photios.
Below is Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils Vol I. Nicaea I to Lateran V edited by Norman P. Tanner SJ. https://t.co/sbmtD23SbB
@g_mancz The 5th was ratified by the Patriarchs, but Vigilius was suspended, yet it was enough to make it ecumenical, per Nicaea II https://t.co/uUDxFirAyT
@g_mancz The canons are binding, since they were accepted in Trullo, which was accepted in Nicaea II.
@g_mancz Yet, the acceptance of it in Trullo, and Nicaea II means that Chalcedon 28th canon is valid. 
Just as later acceptance of Constance as a Council means that the council is valid and ecumenical, therefore, John 23rd was not an antipope.
@leslieginlewes @JustAllynHirsch And of course, the council of Frankfurt rejected and condemned Nicaea II ( though that was a western council )
Check : https://t.co/gKg4KvlcMR
2/2
@matthewpao1 @strivetobekind According to Nicaea II, it never needed Vigilius' approval. The approval of the 4 Patriarchs was enough. https://t.co/KwHirllSuT
@matthewpao1 @strivetobekind In the same way, Nicaea II wouldn't refer to the 5th as ecumenical if it needed the approval of the pope, whom the 5th suspended. Yet, it affirm it is ecumenical, because it was approved by the 4 Patriarchs. Rome is irrelevant, it had majority ratification by the others.
@matthewpao1 @strivetobekind Source: trust me bro

Vigilius was taken into captivity, and forced to accept it by the Emperor, and was only released once he done so. By roman standard, that is invalid coz it wasn't his free choice.

Nicaea II says it is ecumenical, and ratified by 4 Patriarchs.

Deal with it.
@mfjlewis @martinconnell Nicea didn't bother them? The Apostle John was a quartodeciman.
@smashbaals Second Council of Nicaea: https://t.co/EWcgeQMdN7
@standev9 @apoc_12 Aquinas also said that you have to worship the cross and images of Christ by giving latria to them, despite Nicaea II condemning such pagan nonsense.
@standev9 @apoc_12 Except, Nicaea II in its letter to the Emperors explain that: "we together sing: We reverence (προσκυνῶμεν), your cross, O Lord, and we also reverence (προσκυνῶμεν) the spear which opened the life-giving side of your goodness. This is clearly but a salutation"

Not latria.
@strivetobekind @PDamian19 Hadrian who accepted Trullo and its canons, same with Nicaea II which likewise accepted Trullo which in can 36 say that Constantinople have equal privileges as Rome and in can 20 contradict univers. papal jurisdiction and at other places condemns roman practises. Right.
@strivetobekind I linked regarding V1 in the other comment. Regarding Nicaea II, yes it does. It disprove the hieria council by saying that it did not enjoy the approval of the Patriarchs and that is the reason why that is not ecumenical.
@strivetobekind It violates the Apostolic Canons because it states that the Pope cannot do anything without the consent of the Church. 

It violates Nicaea II because for a council to be ecumenical it has to be approved by the Patriarchs, whereas V1 recognizes the western councils as such
14. The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with Gnosticism, nor "removing" the Gnostics Gospels from the Bible.
Gnosticism was not an issue at Nicaea. Not did Nicaea have ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

The matter never even came up at Nicaea.
2. The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books to include in the Bible and which to leave out.

That is a myth that was started by Voltaire in the 18th Century &amp; popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel &amp; movie The DaVinci Code
6. The Trinity is COMPLETELY Biblical. The term "Trinity" is not in the Bible, but everything that is MEANT by that term IS taught in the Bible.
7. The Emperor Constantine did NOT force belief in the Trinity on the Church. He actually supported the ARIANS at Nicaea.
@0ccultbot The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "editing" the Bible or determining the Biblical Canon.

You are WRONG about Nicaea.
@136Dangelo @Sim_TBL @amb443 @mackio_ The Content of the Bible was NOT a matter that was dealt with at Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea never even discussed the matter.
@1DoctorPoison @MiekWeek @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta It means I know History and have actually READ the documents from the Council of Nicaea and the writings of the Early Church.

It means I certainly know more about this than you do, and yet you seem to feel perfectly qualified to speak on something you actually DON'T know about.
@1DoctorPoison @MiekWeek @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta The idea that the Council of Nicaea picked the books of the Bible IS a Conspiracy Theory.

The idea that the Council of Nicaea INVENTED the Doctrine of the Trinity and the idea that Christ is God IS a Conspiracy Theory.

They aren't supported by the actual Historical records.
@1DoctorPoison @MiekWeek @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta They all taught the full Deity of Christ (as well as his full Humanity), CENTURIES before Nicaea.

It was in fact Arianism, which DENIES the Deity of Christ, that arose in the late 3rd, early 4th Century.

That's WHY Arius was condemned at two separate Synods in Alexandria &amp; then
@1DoctorPoison @MiekWeek @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta Yeah, see, I ACTUALLY have read the original source materials.

This isn't something I got from a Google search.

I have a degree in History and a Master's Degree with a focus in Church History.

I have in fact read the Canons of the Council of Nicaea (the record of the official

I've actually read their writings.
And I have read
@1DoctorPoison @MiekWeek @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta the writings of the Early Church Fathers from the late 1st-4th Centuries.

ALL of them taught the Deity of Christ LONG before Nicaea.

Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Papias, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus of Lyons, Theophilus of Antioch AND Theophilus of Caesarea, etc
@1DoctorPoison @MiekWeek @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta was ultimately condemned at Nicaea. It is specifically BECAUSE Arius' teachings were contrary to the teaching of the Christian faith from the 1st Century forward. 

Even from the 1st Century, the Early Church Fathers taught the Deity of Christ.

@4eva1984 @4doormorewhore1 @BastardOnerous @dj_croftt @ThePaulaMartino @mjs_DC The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing what books to include in the Bible.

That is a modern myth popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. It is Fiction.

@5whoopdiedoo @AdoptADeafCat @BunnySql @Tracey_dont_lie @pete51754 @laurenboebert Did you even READ the article you yourself posted here?

Not one SCRAP of a mention of the Council of Nicaea choosing which books to include in the Bible and which to leave out.

READ your own article that YOU posted. 

Because the Council of Nicaea never even addressed the issue

@6mJustSeemsHigh @BitcoinHobbes The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with canonizing the Bible. 

In fact, the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea at all.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@AChromaticHeavn @DrShayPhD No, neither did the Council of Nicaea choose the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

The issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea.
It was not even an issue they dealt with at all.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@AChromaticHeavn @DrShayPhD The Council of Nicaea didn't make ANY pronouncements regarding the nature of Hell.

I swear peope just take anything you don't like or understand about Christianity and blame it on the Council of Nicaea without ever fact checking to be sure it is correct!
https://t.co/CJTedfMGtq
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex Also, I have read the actual records from the Council of Nicaea.

I have read all of the Gnostic Gospels &amp; the writings of the Early Church Fathers.

This is History, not faith.

You don't have to have ANY belief in the Bible to understand that it WASN'T Canonized at Nicaea.
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex And here are the ORIGINAL SOURCE documents, the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex And here is the story of how the Myth about Nicaea choosing the Books of the Bible got started in the 18th Century by the philosopher Voltaire.

(The author of the article is an ATHEIST)
https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex I'm simply saying that the historical records show that the Council of Nicaea DID NOT choose or determine the Canon of the Bible.

What you choose to believe about the Bible itself is irrelevant to that historical fact.
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex No, actually, they don't.

Renowned ATHEIST Historian and Biblical Scholar, Bart Ehrman, also confirms that Nicaea DIDN'T pick the books of the Bible.

https://t.co/avpQEtMhvE
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex No, actually, they don't.

https://t.co/avpQEtMhvE
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex Objectively, from a purely Historical point of view, not from a Faith point of view, but based purely on the actual Historical records, the Council of Nicaea did NOT decide the books of the Bible.

There's no evidence it was ever even DISCUSSED, much less voted on or decided.
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex So, if he gets the beliefs of the Gnostics EXACTLY BACKWARDS, I really don't have much respect for his "research" acumen.

Even the atheist Biblical Scholar and Historian, Bart Ehrman, says Brown was completely wrong about both the Council of Nicaea and the Gnostics.
@AGentleWolf @george_komath @GravelRobin @michaelmathew91 @AJMackinnon @Pontifex Yes, I have. 

And their conclusions are disputed by pretty much EVERY Historian out there.

And their claims about Nicaea have been demonstrated to be based on an 18th Century myth started by Voltaire, with no actual historical basis for it.
@AJLane54 @dinosaur_dapper @PressX_toDoubt Others go even further and claim that not only was the Bible WRITTEN by the Council of Nicaea, but JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF was INVENTED at Nicaea!

I mean, it's ridiculous!

It's like Historical evidence doesn't matter AT ALL to them, just their anti-Christian narrative.
@AJLane54 @dinosaur_dapper @PressX_toDoubt This. It's one of the most widely held historical fallacies.
Everything they don't like or understand about Christianity gets blamed on the Council of Nicaea.
They falsely claim Nicaea chose the books of the Bible. Or that they invented the Divinity of Christ.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA Arianism arose in the late 3rd, early 4th Century. 

Trinitarianism was the accepted belief of the Church both after AND BEFORE Nicaea.

The Nicene Creed was meant to clarify &amp; defend the PRE-EXISTING beliefs of the Church, not to invent new beliefs.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA As I have demonstrated, Christians believed Jesus was GOD INCARNATE from the very beginning.

Your claim that the belief was invented at Nicaea is demonstrated to be false.

Your claim that before Nicaea, Jesus was believed to be a human Prophet is also shown to be false.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA But even the Canons of Nicaea (325) &amp; Constantinople (381) only defined the Bishop of Rome as FIRST AMONG 5 Patriarchs. Not as Supreme Pontiff over the whole Church.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA I have ALREADY proven this claim to be false. He was believed to be God LONG before Nicaea, in fact, from the very BEGINNING.

Are you not keeping up with our discussion?

I just PROVED that conclusively, yet you are repeating ALREADY DEBUNKED claims.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA Islam came along 600 yrs AFTER Christianity and 300 yrs after Nicaea. By your own reckoning your statement cannot be true.

There was NEVER a time in Christianity before Jesus was worshipped. He was worshipped from the VERY BEGINNING.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA My point is that from the 1st Century forward, Christ was ALWAYS believed to be Divine.

Don't move the goal posts now that you have been proven wrong.

You claimed that BEFORE NICAEA he was believed to be merely a human Prophet. I have demonstrated that this is FALSE!
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA NO group of Christians believed that Jesus was "merely a human prophet the way the Muslims believe" prior to Nicaea. Not a single group.

Not the Arians, not the Gnostics, not the Sabellians or the Melitians or the Marcionites. None of them. 

NONE. OF. THEM.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA The Pre-Nicene Church Fathers all believed in the Deity of Christ and the Holy Spirit. This was not invented at Nicaea.

The one innovation of Nicaea was to use the term "Homoousios" to clarify what was MEANT when we called Christ God (Which all the Early Church Fathers did.)
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA Thus is completely untrue.

First, the belief in Jesus' Divinity LONG predated Nicaea. From the 1st Century forward, Jesus was ALWAYS believed to be the Divine Son of God Incarnate.

It was written in the Scriptures. The Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Century believed it.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA You make these assertions without ANY EVIDENCE. You just SAY it &amp; provide no proof of your claims. 

I have showed you PROOF that you are objectively WRONG about when the belief in Jesus' Deity began. I proved it WASN'T invented at Nicaea, but was the belief from the 1st Century.
@AREMO_OLUSHOLA accurate or a meaningful paradigm to understand their world. 

Some of the leading figures at Nicaea were actually Black. Athanasius of Alexandria, the lead Trinitarian bishop, was a Black African. He was short in stature so his nickname was "the Black Dwarf".
@AWillToThink @jdaniel3636 @noah_nonsense @DLgodlessbitch And even though he backed the Niceans in the end, like the savvy politician he was, backing the winning side, he quickly RENEGED on that support soon after Nicaea, and he began to support the Arians again and began persecuting Nicene bishops.
@AWillToThink @jdaniel3636 @noah_nonsense @DLgodlessbitch I take issue with you saying Constantine "took critical Christian Doctrine into his own hand". 

Constantine did NOT shape Christian doctrine.

Constantine himself actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. The Council ruled AGAINST his preferred side.
@Abstruse (BTW, the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T determine the Canon of the Bible. That is a common misconception.)
@AceAsh12 Also, NO ONE at the Council of Nicaea was a Caucasian. Not one.

Most of them were people of color. The lead Bishop at Nicaea, Athanasius of Alexandria, was a black African from Egypt. There were also Copts, Ethiopians, Syrians, Greeks, Arabs, and Italians.

No Caucasians.
@AceAsh12 Christianity didn't become the State Religion at Nicaea.

Constantine issues the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, which granted Religious toleration for ALL religions, including Christianity &amp; ended 300 yrs of persecution.

But Christianity didn't become the State Religion until 380 AD.
@AceAsh12 Nicaea was purely THEOLOGICAL, not political.

Constantine may have had some political motives for calling the Council, but the Council itself voted independently of his designs.

Constantine favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.

The Council condemned Arianism.

Maybe you should READ your sources before posting them.
@Alexand20148448 @GalacticJack It's not actually true.
Reincarnation was NEVER part of Christian belief in the first place. It wasn't "thrown out".

The Council of Nicaea never even DISCUSSED Reincarnation, much decided to throw it out. Reincarnation is a FAR EASTERN concept that was foreign to Christianity.

African Theology WON at Nicaea.

NOTHING about the Bible.

Not a single one of them were about the Biblical Canon of Scripture.

You are simply WRONG.
What's more, I'm pretty sure you KNOW you are wrong.

No Anglo-Saxons, Germans, French, Russians, or Slavs were present at Nicaea

@AnthonyGugino1 @noah_nonsense @CGreenbeans @SamMulhall @BehaviorReturns @LadyBuGs1010 @KCSLunchLady @PEScorpiio The Council of Nicaea DID NOT determine the Canon of the Bible.

In fact NO Ecumenical Council ever ruled on the Canon of the Bible until the Council of Trent in 1545, but the Canon had been set for over 1,000 yrs by then. (It was about the Protestant rejection of the Apocrypha)

https://t.co/hBLmvpqaBk
@Askwhyisit @SteveMacDonal12 Emperor Constantine actually favored the ARIANS (the ones who DENIED the Deity of Christ) in the lead up to Nicaea.

He only backed the Trinitarians after it became clear that the Council had turned against Arius from the very first session.

And he later reneged on that support.
@Askwhyisit @SteveMacDonal12 He did exile those few Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed, but he rescinded the exile after only 2 yrs.

And then he made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor, and began to persecute the Niceans.
@Askwhyisit @SteveMacDonal12 In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power and influence in the 56 yrs after Nicaea, prompting St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

It took another Church Council at Constantinople in 381 AD to finally defeat Arianism.
@Askwhyisit @SteveMacDonal12 In the last few yrs of Constantine's life, he actively supported Arianism, deposing Nicene bishops and replacing them with Arian bishops.

His sons, Constans and Constantius II, continued his policy of enforced Arianization after his death.

But the belief in the Deity of Christ wasn't INVENTED there. It long predated Nicaea.

And there is NO evidence they voted on the Bible. None.

It spreads on the Internet via memes, tweets, and FB Posts.
@Askwhyisit But when the Council turned against Arius, Constantine, ever the savvy politician, backed the winning side.
He exiled the Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed.
But a mere 2 yrs after Nicaea, Constantine brought the Arians back from exile and made Eusebius of Nicomedia his
@Askwhyisit In fact, in the 56 yrs after Nicaea, Arianism actually GREW in power and influence, prompting St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

It took another Church Council in 381 AD at Constantinople to finally defeat Arianism.
@Askwhyisit Jesus was worshiped as God LONG before Nicaea and Constantine. 

Both the Scriptures themselves AND the earliest Church Fathers proclaimed Christ was God Incarnate from the 1st Century forward.
@Askwhyisit Nah, Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to the Council of Nicaea.

They actually voted AGAINST his desires.

Constantine's sister was an Arian sympathizer and Eusebius of Nicomedia, a key ally of Arius, was an advisor to the Emperor.
@Askwhyisit Sorry, friend, that's not what happened. The belief in the Deity of Christ LONG preceded the Council of Nicaea. It was taught from the 1st Century forward.

Lots of misinformation &amp; Conspiracy Theories out there about the Council of Nicaea.
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@Askwhyisit personal Spiritual Advisor.
At Eusebius' urging Constantine began to persecute the Niceans, deposing Nicene bishops and replacing them with Arian bishops.

After his death, his sons, Constans and Constantius II continued this policy of enforced Arianization.
@At0micTh0mas @marcbel19406167 @FrogEmperor2 That's not correct.
The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books would be included in the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

@AthousandBrains @kamogazlatan @JtabNtumba @em_alrightt Contrary to popular myth the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T compile, edit, or choose the Books of the Bible.

@Augie2018 @prolifichosky @Spaceboy2021 @JackPosobiec The Bishop of Rome did not have or even claim universal Supremacy over the whole Church in the 4th Century. The Councils of Nicaea &amp; Constantinople only affirmed a status of something akin to "First Among Equals".
Papal Supremacy was an evolving concept.

No indication anywhere of the Council choosing or removing any books of the Bible.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@BDrabit @GOSBIZ @AnofeGafa @okayodejohnson @Iamkingsleyf Neither the Council of Nicaea of 325 AD, nor the King James Translators in 1611 "removed and burned" books of the Bible.

@Ballin_20 @MwmSpectrum Again and again you keep repeating this ALREADY DISPROVED lie. 

No, the Deity of Christ was NOT "introduced into Christendom at Nicaea in 325 AD"

I have already PROVEN that it was believed in the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries.

I showed you PROOF of this.

Yet you continue this lie.
@Ballin_20 @MwmSpectrum I just showed you PROOF that you are wrong.
Not only the Scriptures, but also the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries LONG BEFORE Nicaea.

You are simply FACTUALLY WRONG.
The Deity of Christ was believed from the very beginning.
https://t.co/NfSextqYeu https://t.co/o32MJmkGri
@Ballin_20 @MwmSpectrum Not so. The belief in the Deity of Christ began in the 1st Century, and was believed from the beginning.
(John 1:1-18, John 5:18, John 8:57, John 10:30-33, Col 2:9, Heb 1:3, etc) &amp; taught by the Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries LONG before Nicaea. https://t.co/BiR5hMu14r
@Ballin_20 @MwmSpectrum This is EXACTLY what the Scriptures teach in Hebrews 1:3, Phil 2:5-11, Col 2:9, etc.

And it is EXACTLY what is taught at Nicaea when they say that the Son has the SAME NATURE (Homoousios) with the Father.

It acknowledges both the Distinctions of Persons &amp; the Oneness of Essence

It wasn't an event. It was a process that spanned nearly 500 yrs. It wasn't decide by a single man or group
@Bearfeet101 @ikereyes1984 @Cernovich Eusebius of Caesarea, Eusebius of Nicomedia, and even Constantine himself.

No evidence in ANY of the original source materials of any discussion, votes, or decisions regarding what books go in the Bible at Nicaea.

I have read the writings of the people who were actually THERE at Nicaea. Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius of Alexandria, Arius,
@Bearfeet101 @ikereyes1984 @Cernovich It was a far more organic process of the gradual consensus of ALL the churches. It happened in stages, not in a single event.

And the Council of Nicaea wasn't actually involved in the process at all. They didn't even DISCUSS the matter, much less vote on it.

https://t.co/DseHAMtqYU
@BeeGarner48 @tian_valerian @itzruhama No. It was NOT DEBATED AT NICAEA AT ALL.

Nicaea made NO decisions about the Biblical Canon.

Jerome's one mention of Nicaea in regards to Judith only indicates that someone at Nicaea QUOTED from the book of Judith in one of their arguments, citing it as Scripture. That's it.
@BeeGarner48 @tian_valerian @itzruhama The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with any of that.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not setting the Biblical Canon.

They never even discussed the matter, much less decided on it.
@BeeGarner48 @tian_valerian @itzruhama Those who were actually THERE at Nicaea don't indicate that any such debate or discussion happened, much less a vote on it.

Jerome merely meant that someone at Nicaea cited the Book of Judith in one of his remarks, referring to it as Scripture. That's ALL his quote means.
@BeeGarner48 @tian_valerian @itzruhama You cannot take one bare quote from Jerome about the Book of Judith and build an entire narrative about the Council of Nicaea debating and deciding the Canon of the Bible. There's absolutely NO evidence that such a thing happened at Nicaea. The Canons of Nicaea don't indicate it.
@BeeGarner48 @tian_valerian @itzruhama the makeup of the Bible. He neither influenced nor dictated which books to include. And again, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with it in any case. That's NOT what Nicaea was about.
@Behog01 @darryn_briggs @Ethelsboy @ChefJonKung @Thisishowispeak That is simply NOT true.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the myth that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

That myth was first advanced by Pope Gregory I in the late 6th Century.

Nicaea had nothing to do with it.

@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ I only use credible sources. Scholarly sources.

My background is in history.
I have an advanced degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

I have studied the Council of Nicaea and the Canonization of the Bible in great detail over the past 30 years.
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ No, I'm not.

I've spent the last 30 yrs studying the Council of Nicaea and the Canonization of the Bible.

Here's the actual records from Nicaea itself, all the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

No mention of choosing the books of the Bible.
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ No, you are the one changing the subject. I am STAYING on subject...the Council of Nicaea, the Canonization of the Bible.

It is YOU who is moving the goalposts and changing the subject.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ Okay then, SHOW ME the evidence that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

You can't.

Because there ISN'T any.

The Council of Nicaea never dealt with the Biblical Canon.
Nicaea was about the ARIAN Controversy.
I've shown you the documentation of that.
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ Show me the proof of your claim.

Nothing in the Nicene Creed suggests that the Council chose the books of the Bible.

There's literally NO evidence whatsoever to support your claim.
None.

No Historian anywhere supports your assertion. No Historical documents support it.
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining the Biblical Canon.
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ The Council of Nicaea never even DISCUSSED the Biblical Canon, much less decided on it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@BlxckDollar @KSavum @ChrisCh30833074 @MarioVanBryson @ModestMama_ Then there was the fire in 640 AD set by the Muslim Caliph Omar.

None of these were by the order of Constantine or the Council of Nicaea.

@BoBo_BoJangle @sureoverlord @BigCrazyRobot @MsCatholicJules @Heather46006897 @Haniagina @LindhardtEric Neither Christmas nor Easter are of Pagan origins. Both celebrations date back WAY before Nicaea. And Sunday morning worship? Dates back to the 1st Century.
https://t.co/jSBq0OFEhX
@BoBo_BoJangle @sureoverlord @BigCrazyRobot @MsCatholicJules @Heather46006897 @Haniagina @LindhardtEric The beliefs reflected in the Pre-nicene era of Christian writings are the SAME as those of the post-nicene era.

Constantine made NO changes to Christian beliefs or practices. No pagan beliefs or practices were imposed on or mixed with Christianity at Nicaea or thereafter.
@BoBo_BoJangle @sureoverlord @BigCrazyRobot @MsCatholicJules @Heather46006897 @Haniagina @LindhardtEric The pope did not even ATTEND the Council of Nicaea, but only sent his Legates. The Papacy in the 4th Century was not what it would later become. Popes were not yet making claims of Universal Supremacy over the entire Church as they would begin to claim in the 5th Century.
@BoBo_BoJangle @sureoverlord @BigCrazyRobot @MsCatholicJules @Heather46006897 @Haniagina @LindhardtEric There's no question the Vatican has been the center of MANY scandals and Controversies throughout the Centuries.

As I am not Catholic, this doesn't directly affect me.

But none of that has anything to do with the Council of Nicaea.
@Bob4546 @JackPosobiec The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible, my friend. Nothing.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the make up of the Bible.
@Bobby_Bobsson @ChitaluChebo @rausc15 @larryelder Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD.
And Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with editing or compiling the Bible.

Nothing at all.

That is a common misconception.
@Bobby_Bobsson @ChitaluChebo @rausc15 @larryelder They DEFENDED the belief in the Divinity of Christ (which had ALREADY been the belief of the Church even BEFORE Nicaea), codifying it in the Nicene Creed.
@Bojesphob @ismashrobots @megsbeach @GeorgeTakei The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

It is not true.
@BreadintheBone @DustinBenge But you had some inaccuracies as well. That part about the Council of Nicaea...simply factually FALSE.
@BreadintheBone @DustinBenge The New Testament was NOT edited by the Council of Nicaea.

In fact the issue of the Canon of the Bible never even came up at Nicaea.

@Bridget70910605 @SewerRatlord @VazquezUnbrdnd @DrGJackBrown The Council of Nicaea DID NOT decide on which books to include in or exclude from the Bible. 

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the Canon of the Bible.
@Bridget70910605 @SewerRatlord @VazquezUnbrdnd @DrGJackBrown Why don't you read further than that? You will find that the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing or editing the books of the Bible.

Also, very few "Europeans" were at Nicaea. Most were Greeks, Africans, and Middle Eastern + 2 Legates from Rome.
@CARMELOADonato1 @LakotaMan1 Christianity existed for 300 yrs BEFORE Nicaea.

The attendees at Nicaea were 318 CHRISTIAN BISHOPS from across
the Empire. That wouldn't be possible if Christianity didn't EXIST until Nicaea.

We have hundreds of writings from the Early Church Fathers of the 1st-3rd Centuries.
@CARMELOADonato1 @LakotaMan1 That's ridiculous. Jesus was preached by the Apostles and by the Early Church from the 1st Century forward.

He was NOT invented by the Council of Nicaea. https://t.co/ELlElBHQwY
@CDouchekowski @Bogleg @MarkEGDorey1 That the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

They didn't. In fact, the matter never even came up at Nicaea, much less was decided by them.

@CSAbot2 @YoungTrad1 @KingOfSalt4 @RCNonsense 325 AD. 

But the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with writing or determining the content of the Bible
@CSAbot2 @YoungTrad1 @KingOfSalt4 @RCNonsense No, my friend, it didn't. 

Not only did the NOT determine the Biblical Canon, the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up AT ALL at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

Here's what ACTUALLY happened at Nicaea:
https://t.co/CJTedfMGtq
@CSAbot2 @YoungTrad1 @KingOfSalt4 @RCNonsense Show me evidence that the Biblical Canon was decided at Nicaea.

Something OTHER than a MEME you saw on FB or Twitter. ACTUAL evidence.

You can't.

Because it didn't happen.

Here's the ACTUAL records from the Council of Nicaea.

https://t.co/H3KvZmzAL9

Show me... I'll wait...
@CachePast @XX_RealWoman_XX "Nicene Council omitted books."

That is a factually FALSE statement.
And it absolutely has to do with the Canonization of the Bible. If they "omitted books" then they determined certain books were NOT to be included in the Bible.

Which they absolutely DIDN'T do.
@CachePast @XX_RealWoman_XX @laelwix @lesnyxia46 @MahiArchipelago The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with the canonization of the Bible or choosing which books to include in the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@CachePast @XX_RealWoman_XX @laelwix @lesnyxia46 @MahiArchipelago You said "Fake quotations, Nicene Council, omitted books, changes between earliest version and the many versions we have today, etc"

That's not just implying it, that's saying it outright.

And you are wrong about that.
@CachePast @XX_RealWoman_XX @laelwix @lesnyxia46 @MahiArchipelago You said both things, neither of which is correct.

I stand by my criticism because you actually DID say the Council of Nicaea, "omitted books".

Also, the Trinity is ABSOLUTELY Biblical.
@CachePast @XX_RealWoman_XX Please clarify. Did you NOT intend to say that the Council of Nicaea "omitted books"?
@CachePast @XX_RealWoman_XX You said it. I have the receipts.

"Fake quotations, Nicene Council, omitted books, changes between earliest version and the many versions we have today, etc"

Direct quote from YOU.
@CachePast Even the term "Trinity" was coined 150 yrs before Nicaea to describe the belief of the Church in the Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit as one Eternal God.

How could they coin a term for a doctrine that didn't even EXIST yet?
🤔
Because it DID exist and had been taught from the beginning
@CachePast The Council didn't invent the Doctrine of the Trinity.

The Doctrine of the Trinity LONG preceded Nicaea.

Nicaea DEFENDED AND CLARIFIED the Doctrine of the Trinity in order to correct the errors of Arianism.

It did introduce some precise Theological terminology, but that is all
@CallistoCommish @OhHowByronic @thegoodgodabove Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Bible.
@CallistoCommish @OhHowByronic @thegoodgodabove Here's the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

@CallistoCommish @OhHowByronic @thegoodgodabove Nope. The Council of Nicaea did NOT decide on the books to include in the New Testament.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized recently by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, then spread on the internet by memes and Social Media.
@CallistoCommish @OhHowByronic @thegoodgodabove They tell the story about how the Bible was actually canonized and debunk the myth that the Council of Nicaea had anything to do with it.
@Canadianmouse2 @PastorMattHagee The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with debating or deciding which Books to include in or exclude from the Bible.

@CapsRidgeTrail @dufrianord @tweetannylee @LayahHeilpern I have actually READ the original source materials from Nicaea.

Have you?
There's ZERO mention of them choosing the books of the Bible.

Because it didn't happen.
Here's the actual records from Nicaea. Read them yourself. It's not in there.
https://t.co/H3KvZmzAL9
@CapsRidgeTrail @dufrianord @tweetannylee @LayahHeilpern Jesus had been preached as Divine from the very beginning.
It is proclaimed clearly throughout the New Testament, and in the writings of the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, LING before Constantine or Nicaea. https://t.co/Kh5QQNqgXN
@CapsRidgeTrail @dufrianord @tweetannylee @LayahHeilpern Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 324 AD.

Yes, they voted to DEFEND AND CLARIFY the Divinity of Christ, not to INVENT it. I have posted quotations (I have many others) from Historical records which demonstrate that the Divinity of Christ was already widely believed BEFORE Nicaea.
@CaptSassyPants1 @artloverloveart @__tirzah__ @signatureclassy @KingOfSalt4 The Council of Nicaea ONLY focused on the Arian Controversy. No other theological issue was dealt with except the Arian controversy.

And even the Arians didn't believe that Jesus was merely a human Prophet.

You are simply historically WRONG about this.
@CaptSassyPants1 @artloverloveart @__tirzah__ @signatureclassy @KingOfSalt4 This is simply NOT true. 
The Divinity of Christ was believed from the very beginning of the Christian faith. It is taught in Scripture. It was believed by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, LONG before Nicaea. https://t.co/Cl9x9iIWo3
@CardinalChaos2 @Marvel0usJesus Arian, not Aryan.

@CarlosCmorcate Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 315 AD.
And NO ONE was killed as a result of the Council of Nicaea. No heretics were executed. They were exiled. And then brought back a short 2 yrs later.
Then Constantine made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia his personal Spiritual Advisor!

@Cayde7666 @SaltySeaLawyer @thecandaceshow @RealCandaceO I have an advanced degree in History &amp; a Master's with a focus in Church History from 2 accredited universities.

I can tell you definitively that neither Constantine NOR the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.
@Cayde7666 @SaltySeaLawyer @thecandaceshow @RealCandaceO If your "degree in Religious studies" taught you that Constantine and the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible, I would question the accreditation of the school.

It is factually, historically FALSE.

@Cecilia86740330 @JDwJC11 @MaryMargOlohan But the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T choose the books of the Bible and compile it. They had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining the content of the Bible.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@Cecilia86740330 @JDwJC11 @MaryMargOlohan So...WHY did you say that the Council of Nicaea decided what books to include in the Bible if you knew they DIDN'T?

That doesn't make sense.
@Cecilia86740330 @JDwJC11 @MaryMargOlohan The Latin Vulgate was NOT compiled at the Council of Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD &amp; had absolutely NOTHING to do with compiling the Bible.

The Vulgate was translated from the Greek &amp; Hebrew texts into Latin by Jerome between 383-404 AD, over 50 yrs AFTER Nicaea.
@Cecilia_St @GenIsSolo You understand that the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with editing or choosing the Books of the Bible, right?

That is a common misconception.
They didn't even DISCUSS the Canon of Scripture at Nicaea, much less choose or edit the books of the Bible.
@CelestineBee @JamesGerrard Actually, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be excluded.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@Chas1137 @DontCallMeDebby 1. This is a JOKE, Dude. It's called humor. That actually IS a picture of Keith Richards. 🙄
2. The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T "rewrite" the Bible, or have ANYTHING to do with the Biblical Canon at all.
@CherylAMadden @LakotaMan1 Christ was proclaimed as Divine from the very beginning of the Christian faith. It is not only declared in the Scriptures, but it was preached by the Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, LONG before Nicaea. https://t.co/Dle7H5kXlD
@ChrisSh21497735 @GenIsSolo There was no single "group of men that decided which texts were in and which were out". (And BTW, the Council of Nicaea had NOTHING at all to do with it, contrary to popular myth)

The Canonization of the Bible was a PROCESS, not an event, that took nearly 500 yrs.
@ChrisTussVictor @AdamToMessiah Also, Nicaea didn't have anything to do with Gnosticism either.

The issue at Nicaea was ARIANISM, not Gnosticism, not defining the Biblical Canon.

Stop getting your knowledge of history and Religion from memes.
@ChrisTussVictor @AdamToMessiah The Bible was NOT Canonized at Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea literally had NOTHING to do with the content or canonization of the Bible.

@Chriscck369 @grcastleberry The Council of Nicaea actually made NO CHANGES to the content of the Bible at all. In fact, the subject of the content of the Bible and what books should be included in it NEVER CAME UP at Nicaea.

@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius Also, the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "choosing" the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea. It took another 56 yrs, and another Church Council at Constantinople in 381 AD to finally defeat Arianism.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius At Eusebius' urging, Constantine began persecuting Nicene Christians, deposing Nicene bishops and replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire, a policy continued by his sons, Constans and Constantius II, after his death.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius But that support was to be short lived. A scant 2 yrs after Nicaea, Constantine rescinded their exile and brought them back, making Eusebius of Nicomedia, the lead Arian bishop, his personal Spiritual Advisor. He threw in his lot with the Arians and started persecuting Niceans.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius Certainly.

The Council of Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not about deciding the books of the Bible.
The idea that Nicaea chose the books of the Bible is an 18th Century myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread by memes &amp; Social Media
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius Here's what ACTUALLY happened at the Council of Nicaea.

https://t.co/CJTedg4PHy
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius Most of the people at the Council of Nicaea were NOT "white". They were Greeks, Africans, Middle Easterners, Syrians, even Persians, and a pair of Italian Legates from Rome.

The lead Bishop of the Council was Athanasius of Alexandria, a black African from Egypt.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius No, my friend. They were orthodox Christians. In fact, it was Athanasius of Alexandria, a black African, who helped establish the Nicene Creed.

The Coptic Church of Alexandria and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church are two of the OLDEST Christian communities in the world.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius The men at Nicaea would rather have died than accept pagan beliefs polluting the pure faith of the Apostles. There were many men there who had endured much suffering for the faith and who would never have agreed to such compromises with paganism had it been pressed on them.
@Cloud777MG @NenoSavvy @MsJuicyGenius They stood for the Apostolic faith even though the Emperor Constantine himself actually preferred the Arians over the orthodox Christians in the lead up to Nicaea.

They expressed their independence from the Emperor by voting to CONDEMN the Arians

He reluctantly backed orthodoxy
@CommentaryMarie @KhadijaSunset Nope.
The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It never even came up at Nicaea, much less was decided on by them.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@CommentaryMarie @KhadijaSunset Nope. The Doctrine of the Trinity LONG preceded Nicaea. Even the term "Trinity" itself was coined in the 2nd Century by Tertullian.

How could a term be coined in the 2nd Century for a Doctrine that didn't EXIST until the 4th Century?🤔

It was taught in the 1st-3rd Century. https://t.co/8XresI5VYC
@CommentaryMarie @hearethree @KhadijaSunset It does, actually, since we have the writings of the ante-nicene Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries and can confirm that the faith affirmed at Nicaea was indeed the SAME faith that was preached from the beginning. https://t.co/hqQ35zRr2F
@CommentaryMarie @hearethree @KhadijaSunset The Arian Controversy started in Africa &amp; the African churches were well represented at Nicaea. The most important of them being Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius of Alexandria &amp; Arius of Alexandria.

There were also bishops from Ethiopia, Greece, Syria, Asia Minor, Italy, etc.
@ComplexDigi @limolnar @booma888rv @buudgreen @SHEsus__Christ @realTuckFrumper No, the Council did not decide on ANY books of the Bible.

The makeup of the Biblical Canon was NOT a subject the Council of Nicaea dealt with AT ALL. 

They made NO decisions about which books to include in or exclude from the Bible at Nicaea.
@ComplexDigi @limolnar @booma888rv @buudgreen @SHEsus__Christ @realTuckFrumper The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with interpolating or putting together the Bible.

@CrastoMervin @homeopathy2010 @BrethrenIndia @abs_pc1 @Dharma_4_U @shudntbehere But one thing that they DIDN'T decide on was what books were to be included in the Bible. 

That was never even DISCUSSED at Nicaea.
@Cre8Liberty @JimL1975 And, also like a politician, he quickly RENEGED on that support soon after Nicaea. He agreed to exile all those who refused to sign the Nicene Creed. 
But 2 short yrs later, he rescinded their exile and brought them back &amp; made the lead Arian bishop his personal Spiritual Advisor
@Cre8Liberty @JimL1975 The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 425.

And although Constantine was the "ceremonial chair" of the Council, he actually had no vote or say in the proceedings.

In fact, he favored the ARIANS, who were CONDEMNED by the Council.

He ended up backing the Niceans, but only
@CrusaderRoyal @4SkinLord_4922_ @lomlloey @Styx666Official Also, most people don't get that misinformation from the DaVinci Code directly. Mostly they get it from memes and Conspiracy Theories on Social Media.

The actual Historical records show NO evidence whatsoever that Nicaea even DISCUSSED the Canon of the Bible, much less decided.
@CrusaderRoyal @4SkinLord_4922_ @lomlloey @Styx666Official Here's the actual Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.
https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

No indication anywhere that they chose or wrote the books of the Bible.
@CrusaderRoyal @4SkinLord_4922_ @lomlloey @Styx666Official Yeah Nicaea had nothing to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls either.

The Essene community at Qumran was an Apocalyptic JEWISH sect.

Their writings weren't accepted by mainstream Judaism out of which Christianity was born. That's why their writings weren't in our Bibles.
@CrusaderRoyal @4SkinLord_4922_ @lomlloey @Styx666Official You do know that the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "writing" the Bible or choosing which books to include in the Bible, right?

That's an 18th Century Myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread by memes &amp; SM.
@DBuckmier @16Suse @SiriusBShaman Here is an example of the writings of Arius of Alexandria, the Egyptian Presbyter whose sparked the Arian controversy that caused the Council of Nicaea to be called in the first place:

https://t.co/SedKmVqzi3
@DBuckmier @16Suse @SiriusBShaman Here's a great article on the Myth of Nicaea and the Bible vs how the Bible was ACTUALLY canonized.

https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@DBuckmier @16Suse @SiriusBShaman I would expect nothing less.

Here's the documents from the Council of Nicaea itself:
https://t.co/VUrj3VgtVL
@DBuckmier @16Suse @SiriusBShaman I've read the actual Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.
And I have read the writings of those who WERE actually there.
@DBuckmier @16Suse @SiriusBShaman We have writings from the losers, too. 

The writings of Arius and Eusebius of Nicomedia who were condemned and exiled by the Council of Nicaea.
@DBuckmier @16Suse @SiriusBShaman We have writings from the losers, too. 

The writings of Arius and Eusebius of Nicomedia who were condemned and exiled by the Council of Nicaea.
@DDedert Gnosticism wasn't even an issue at Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea didn't even discuss Gnosticism.

Nicaea was about confronting ARIANISM, not Gnosticism.

But you are correct that they were Docetics and denied the true Humanity of Christ. They said he only "appeared" human.
@DanMarketing4 @Tkd247_RL @AJA_Cortes @Morpheusresist The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
The issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at all at Nicaea

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@DanRev_docRpill @ReneeFurr Constantine had no interest whatsoever in the Gnostic Gospels, and there's no evidence he ever read them.

He was more influenced by ARIANISM through his sister, Flavia, an Arian sympathizer, and his friend and advisor, Eusebius of Nicomedia, the lead Arian bishop at Nicaea.
@DanRev_docRpill @ReneeFurr Yet when the Council of Nicaea turned against &amp; ultimately condemned Arius, Constantine, ever the savvy politician, backed the winning side.

But he ended up reneging on that support for the Niceans shortly after Nicaea, and began backing the Arians again.
@DarkCummings @scapekid @joero3 Contrary to popular myth the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T "put together" the New Testament or determine the Biblical Canon.

The issue never even came up AT ALL at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@Darthjimscott41 @catolicamaven @ajsteelshow Nicaea II was CENTURIES later and only retroactively made them universal, after the Canon had already been established more through a process of consensus than by unilateral fiat by any single Council.

At the time, the Council did NOT have universal application.
@Darthjimscott41 @catolicamaven @ajsteelshow No, it's a matter of revisionist History. They read Papal Supremacy back into a time when it did not exist in the same way it would Centuries later. It's an Anachronism.
Nicaea I recognized Rome only as one of FOUR great Patriarchal Sees (later 5 including Constantinople as well)
@Darthjimscott41 @catolicamaven @ajsteelshow The Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople established Rome as one of 5 Patriarchs of the Ancient Church, the most important, to be sure, but NOT the SOLE head of the Church.

Pope Leo I began making grandiose claims of absolute power over the Church in the 5th Century. But he
@Dave_Waggy @JadeAllDayUSA2 Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible, which to include, which to exclude.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not forming the Bible.
@DavidAJMHoward @BenjaminRVA @dicetrail @GrantJHillman That is explicitly spelled out in the Canons of Nicaea &amp; Constantinople, establishing the 5 Apostolic Patriarchies. Primacy, yes. See of Final Appeal, yes. Elder brother among equals, yes.

Supreme Pontiff over all other bishops, no.
@DavidDzimianski Can you give an example of "violent Enforcement of said Canon"?

The Biblical Canon was still in flux for over a Century after Nicaea.

I know of no incidents of "violent Enforcement of the Canon" in that time...or really any age until just before the Reformation.

About 300 bishops met in the city of Nicaea (modern day İznik, Turkey) to decide the issue.
Arius was allowed to speak in his own defense, even though he was just a Presbyter (priest), not a bishop. But as he read his statement, the Council immediately

The Council affirmed the Deity of Christ (actually RE-affirmed, since that had been the belief of the Church from the beginning) and drafted the Nicene Creed that affirmed that Christ was "of one substance" (homoousios) with the Father, and was thus truly God Incarnate
@DavidStarcross @LesleyJBF1 @RyanSarai1 Nope. The Council of Nicaea had literally NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include in the Bible. Nothing.
The issue never even came up for discussion.

This is a modern Conspiracy Theory popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

It didn't happen.
@DavidStarcross @NoHolyScripture That's not actually true, my friend.

The Council of Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the Bible.

The idea that Nicaea write or compiled the Bible is an 18th Century myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread via memes &amp; Social Media.
@DavidsChaos13 @OverTheSussy @RealBrysonGray The Council of Nicaea wasn't in Rome. It was in Nicaea, modern day İznik, Turkey.
@DavidsChaos13 @RealBrysonGray However, the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with putting the Bible together.

They never even discussed it, much less decided on it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the Bible.
@DavidsChaos13 @RealBrysonGray Most of the Bishops at Nicaea weren't white. NONE of them were from England or Western Europe. Only 2 were Italian. The rest were African, Coptic, Greek, Syrian, and various other Middle Eastern ethnicities.

The lead Bishop at Nicaea was a Black African, Athanasius of Alexandria
@DavidsChaos13 First, there are the Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

No mention of choosing the books of the Bible. Because they didn't.
@DavidsChaos13 I'm sharing the information.

What you choose to do with it is up to you.

I'm telling you that the actual Historical records don't support the false Narrative that Constantine and the Council of Nicaea chose the Bible. I'm telling you that it was a more organic process.
@DebbieB75118015 Also, there are a lot of false Conspiracy Theories associated with the Council of Nicaea.

Here's a little bit more about those:
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@DebbieB75118015 What are you talking about? The Council of Nicaea is WELL KNOWN in most churches. Many churches actually recite the Nicene Creed every Sunday.

It may be unknown to many Evangelicals, but not because it was "suppressed", but because most Evangelicals are IGNORANT of History.
@Deliriousred1 @LaBoomer68 Actually, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be excluded. 

That is a modern Myth popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. It never actually happened.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@Democracywarri2 Constantine had absolutely NOTHING to do with changing or altering the Bible. Nor did the Council of Nicaea.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT about determining the Biblical Canon.

Constantine DID NOT change the Bible.
@Democracywarri2 The idea that Constantine or the Council of Nicaea chose the Books of the Bible is an 18th Century myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. Then it spread on the internet via memes &amp; Social Media.
@DeshonePitt @RoaaJA2 @hassananisa434 For crying out loud, you claimed that Nicaea was in 323 BC!

You have no CLUE what you are even TALKING about!
@DeshonePitt @RoaaJA2 @hassananisa434 Nicaea was in 325 AD. 

And Christianity existed for nearly 300 years before Nicaea. They didn't "invent" Christianity at Nicaea.

We have writings of the Early Church Fathers from the first 300 yrs of Christianity BEFORE Nicaea. We know what they believed &amp; how they worshipped.
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo At Eusebius' urging, Constantine began deposing Nicene bishops and replacing them with Arian bishops in key Sees throughout the Empire.

After his death, his sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, continued this policy.

In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo But Constantine reneged on his support for Nicene Christianity shortly after Nicaea.

2 yrs later, he rescinded their exile and brought them back, making the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor.

Then he began persecuting Nicene bishops.
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo But again, historically, it was the Nicene Christians, NOT the Arians, who were persecuted at Alexandria after Nicaea.

Constantine turned on the Nicene Christians and began persecuting them.

Historically, what actually happened was exactly the OPPOSITE of what you claimed.
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo Except exactly the OPPOSITE happened.

Constantine had been sympathetic to the Arians even before Nicaea. His Sister, Flavia was an Arian sympathizer, and his close advisor, Eusebius of Nicomedia, was an ally of Arius.

But the Council turned against Arius from the very first.
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo It took another 56 yrs and another Church Council, at Constantinople in 381 AD, to finally defeat Arianism within the Empire.

Outside Roman borders, however, Arianism continued to thrive among the Germanic barbarian tribes for several more Centuries before they accepted Nicaea.
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo The Council of Nicaea voted AGAINST the Emperor's preferred side. But Constantine, ever the savvy politician, backed the winning side...at least at first.

He exiled the Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed, including his friend Eusebius of Nicomedia.
@DigiWaffles @berryblackwater @BamaSox @noah_nonsense @bayou_chip @realchrisrufo But it's growth happened primarily AFTER Nicaea, not before. It was mostly limited to Egypt before Nicaea.
@DigiWaffles @berryblackwater @BamaSox @noah_nonsense @bayou_chip @realchrisrufo The belief in the Deity of Christ was the pre-existing defacto belief of the Church, which is why Arius' teachings were condemned at 2 local Synods in Alexandria as well as at the Council of Nicaea.

But Arius had a large following and powerful friends, like Eusebius of Nicomedia
@DinosaurJello @noah_nonsense Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea actually had ANYTHING to do with choosing the Canon of the Bible.

@DiscordantPanic @arc_zoe_ @RealSoodonym @Some_Weirdo__ @EnyaBuisness @auspicioussauce @ShellyGirl101 @todayyearsoldig Oh, also, the King James Version didn't come along until 1611, so why you would include that in this discussion, I don't know.

There is literally NO historical connection between the Council of Nicaea and the translation of the King James Bible.

They are 1,300 yrs apart.
@DiscordantPanic @arc_zoe_ @RealSoodonym @Some_Weirdo__ @EnyaBuisness @auspicioussauce @ShellyGirl101 @todayyearsoldig Perhaps.

But you are simply FACTUALLY wrong.

The "Canons" formed at Nicaea were the Nicene Creed and the rules governing bishops NOT the Bible.

They didn't even discuss what books to include in the Bible at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@DiscordantPanic @arc_zoe_ @RealSoodonym @Some_Weirdo__ @EnyaBuisness @auspicioussauce @ShellyGirl101 @todayyearsoldig The Council of Nicaea set 20 Canons. They all related to the appointment, powers, behavior, and discipline of Bishops.

These were rules governing bishops, not the books of the Bible they were talking about.

@Diviance1 @Kristinxwu1980 @johnthomas1536 @LouisKuhelj @op_atheist Because they are quoted by and cited by other contemporary writers who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

Particularly, Eusebius of Caesarea.
@Diviance1 @Kristinxwu1980 @johnthomas1536 @LouisKuhelj @op_atheist No, I'm asking what kind of evidence YOU would need to see that would convince you that these Canons of Nicaea were actually authentic.

What would be convincing to YOU?
@Diviance1 @Kristinxwu1980 @johnthomas1536 @LouisKuhelj @op_atheist So, we have the Ancient documents, and we have corroboration from witnesses who were there, and the acceptance of those Canons by the churches.

Multiple copies of the Canons of Nicaea along with the Creed and Synodical Letter were sent to churches across the Empire. These agree.
@Diviance1 @Kristinxwu1980 @johnthomas1536 @LouisKuhelj @op_atheist The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding the Christian Canon of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@Diviance1 @Kristinxwu1980 @johnthomas1536 @LouisKuhelj @op_atheist Yet you somehow had no problem believing WITHOUT evidence of ANY kind, that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

You are apparently very selective as to when you demand absolute proof of things and when you just accept them without even looking at ANY evidence.
@Diviance1 @SkepticSpamton @Kristinxwu1980 @johnthomas1536 @LouisKuhelj @op_atheist Both Christian AND non-Christian scholars agree that these are authentic records from Nicaea.

I don't know what else to tell you. 
From an objective scientific point of view, they are genuine.
@DoctorGerhard @jimaggie93 @NoboastbutJesus The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books would be included in the Bible.

@Donda_HM @smalzin10 The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

The Gnostics Gospels were all written in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Century, meaning they couldn't have been written by an Apostle. They were clearly forgeries, which is why they aren't in our Bibles.
@DrSydneyRenee @CRoadwarrior @akaspunkynana @SamforOhio The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include in the Bible. That's an 18th century Myth started by Voltaire and popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

@Duskwitch22 @Outlawmule1 @justina7loren The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 500 AD.

@EnmityandRage @FreyaMeansLady2 I do say so. And so does the historical record.

There's NO evidence of ANYONE being killed by or because of the Council of Nicaea.

None.

If you have evidence to the contrary, please present it. Otherwise you are just assuming without evidence.
@EnmityandRage @FreyaMeansLady2 The Crusades began over 700 yrs after Nicaea.

Nicaea was in 325 AD.

The Crusades were from 1095 - 1291 AD.
@EnmityandRage No, I said no one died in the IMMEDIATE aftermath of Nicaea.

I didn't mean no one EVER died at the hands of the Church EVER.

But those kinds of heinous practices didn't really get started until much later.
@EnmityandRage The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with writing, translating, or choosing the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@EnmityandRage They didn't choose the word of God. 

I told you. Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Bible.
@EricB0709 @DonaldJTrumpJr No, my friend. 

The Council of Nicaea never even DISCUSSED what books to include in the Bible, much less voted on it.

@Exchronos @ShawnYoung19 @JanMentz3 @PennyWrites1 Neither Constantine, nor the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with choosing which books would be in the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by the Philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized by the novel The DaVinci Code.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@FTCInstitute The issue was the Arian Controversy, the question of the Nature of Christ, whether he was truly &amp; fully Divine, or whether he was a lesser, yet Glorified, created being.

Contrary to popular myth, Nicaea actually had NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in the Bible
@FactualAfterDrk @FACTSRTRUTH777 In fact, the Council of Nicaea didn't even DISCUSS which books to include in the Bible. It wasn't even an issue they addressed.

Also, this one:
https://t.co/VdcPwYN09Q
@FactualAfterDrk @FACTSRTRUTH777 had come to accept this Canon universally.

It wasn't done by fiat or decree. It wasn't any single bishop, pope, or Church Council.

It was done by the general consensus of ALL the churches over a period of about 500 yrs.

Nicaea literally had NOTHING to do with it.
@Faircloug4Danny @calvinrobinson The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T remove ANY books from the Bible.

Nor did they make ANY decisions or even DISCUSS which books to include in or exclude from the Bible. 

That is a common misconception.

The Council of Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@Farmmer_11 @NewsToter Church Canon (one "n" in the middle, not 2) Law was certainly drawn up by Nicaea. But these were mainly rules governing Bishops and the calculation of the date of Pascha (Easter).

It was NOT the Canon of the Bible.

@Feefs18 @dk1701 @DMC0821 @KingBeauregard @natlawyerchic @niacerise Yes. I can also tell you he DIDN'T influence or alter Christian beliefs.

@FeezeLes Also, it is a well documented FACT that belief in the Divinity of Christ dates back to the very beginning of the Christian faith, and WAS NOT invented at the Council of Nicaea.

So, feelings aside, beliefs aside, you have made FACTUALLY FALSE statements.
@FeezeLes He was preached as Divine from the very beginning of the Christian faith.

It is taught in Scripture and was preached by the Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, LONG before Nicaea. https://t.co/yh1trpZPQV

You clearly have never studied history or read a SINGLE scholarly source on the matter of canonization.

No reputable scholarly source anywhere says that Nicaea canonized the Bible.

Please educate yourself.
@Fernand10142353 There are 4 Gospels and now I think you are a complete troll just messing with me. 

No credible source anywhere says Nicaea canonized the Bible.

Because it isn't true.

And I'm done with you, troll.
@Fernand10142353 There were 7 Great Ecumenical Church Councils in the first 1,000 yrs of Christianity. Not one of them dealt with the Biblical Canon.

325 AD Nicaea I 
381 AD Constantinople I 
431 AD Ephesus 
451 AD Chalcedon
553 AD Constantinople II
681 AD Constantinople III
787 AD Nicaea II
@Fernand10142353 Where in the WORLD are you getting your information?

THREE Councils of Nicaea?

There were only two. 
Nicaea I in 325 AD
Nicaea II in 787 AD.

Neither of them dealt with the Biblical Canon.

You are either getting info from a bad source, or else you are MAKING THINGS UP ENTIRELY
@FierceDemocracy @Rhamilton76W @BillyGraham Even the famed Atheist Historian &amp; Biblical Scholar Bart Ehrman refutes the idea that the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with determining the Biblical Canon.
https://t.co/avpQEtMhvE
@FierceDemocracy @Rhamilton76W @BillyGraham The Council of Nicaea never even DISCUSSED the Canon of the Bible, much less decided it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the Bible.

Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@FierceDemocracy @Rhamilton76W @BillyGraham The idea that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, then spread on the internet via memes &amp; Social Media.

It is simply not true.
https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@FilledIre @DarkMatter2525 Since belief in the Divinity of Christ LONG preceded Nicaea, that "Interpretation" was already the standard one BEFORE the Nicene Creed was drafted. In fact, that is WHY the Council ruled the way it did and drafted the Creed the way it did. Because they had ALREADY believed it.
@FilledIre @DarkMatter2525 They used previous Translations as a guide for stylistic purposes, but they made a whole new Translation using the best Greek and Hebrew manuscripts available at the time.

Also, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Bible, which you would know if you looked
@Finnatic72 @timb5274 And the Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 327 AD. 

You know...a quick Google search to get your facts straight would probably be a good idea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedfMGtq
@Finnatic72 @timb5274 First of all, the Freemasons didn't even EXIST until the 18th Century.

Secondly, the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T decide which books to include in the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized by the novel The DaVinci Code.
@FiverMacGyver @BrittaniReese90 @TBombadili0 @_154831 The KJV was translated by 47 scholars using the best manuscripts available at the time, the Textus Receptus.

The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T vote any books out or have ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
It isn't true.
@FiverMacGyver @BrittaniReese90 @TBombadili0 @_154831 The fact is that the subject of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea. 

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@FormerGOP_Mom @cewollard @whillikerz @RexChapman Doubt very seriously your Catholic school taught you that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

They know better.

The Council of Nicaea dealt with the Arian Controversy and came up with the original text if the Nicene Creed (which would later be amended in 381AD)
@FormerGOP_Mom @cewollard @whillikerz @RexChapman The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in the Bible or what to leave out.

That is a common misconception.
@FortheLOVEofYAH @Mossadak7 @HallelujahSide But these verses indicate that meeting on Sundays for worship may indeed have begun under the Apostles. Either way, Gentiles are NOT required to keep the Sabbath.

It wasn't Constantine OR the Council of Nicaea that instituted Sunday worship. It began in the 1st Century.
@FreelyMustard @Asiric_Temple The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with Gnosticism. They neither ruled on it nor even discussed it.

Nicaea was about ARIANISM, not Gnosticism.

Gnosticism was a 2nd &amp; 3rd Century heresy that was condemned and rejected without need of a Church Council.
@FreelyMustard @Asiric_Temple You know there were more Church Councils than just Nicaea, right? There were 7 Great Ecumenical Church Councils in the first 800 years of Christianity. None of them dealt with Gnosticism, though.
@FreyaMeansLady2 @EnmityandRage No one was killed by, during, or after the Council of Nicaea.
@FriedScones @GangaBautista @ZaneJensen9 No books were removed from the Bible at the Council of Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible. 

That is a common misconception.

Also the original KJV from 1611 included the Apocrypha.
Later generations of Prots rejected.
@FriendlyMuslima Nope. The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@GBC8407 @noah_nonsense @vanWildgoose @scurvy_beard 1st, Nicaea had nothing at all to do with the Biblical Canon

2nd, the Gnostic Gospels were never part of the Canon to begin with so they couldn't be "removed"

3rd, Gnostics didn't deny Jesus' Divinity. They denied his HUMANITY. 
ARIANISM denied his Divinty, not Gnosticism.
@GBC8407 @noah_nonsense @vanWildgoose @scurvy_beard 4th, the Council of Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT Gnosticism, and NOT the Biblical Canon.

Neither Gnosticism nor the Biblical Canon were even on the agenda at Nicaea.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@GBC8407 @noah_nonsense @vanWildgoose @scurvy_beard The idea that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, and popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, then it spread on the internet via memes and Social Media.

https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@GBC8407 @noah_nonsense @vanWildgoose @scurvy_beard There were NO books removed from the Bible at Nicaea or any other Church Council.

There were books that were never even in consideration for inclusion in the Bible, and there were books that some wanted included that would ultimately be excluded, but no books were "removed".
@GBabySwag91 @realchloenicole @JMcpherrin The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "codifying" the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
It is an 18th Century Myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code and spread on the internet via memes and Social Media.
@GBlackTiger @TomJose75245504 @NancedOff @5Solas2 @BeatTheCult The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, but it had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

In fact the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up AT ALL at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@GalacticJack Reincarnation was NOT an issue that was even DISCUSSED at the Council of Nicaea, much less thrown out.

Karma &amp; Reincarnation are Far Eastern concepts &amp; were NEVER part of Christian beliefs, so they couldn't be "thrown out".

So much bad information about Nicaea. 🙄
@GeeorgeStyles The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD. Not 400 AD.

And no, it was in the city now known as İznik, Turkey.
@Gehazi20492796 @just4whatever1 @smashbaals No, my friend. They didn't even DISCUSS the issue of the Canon of the Bible.

Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council 

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

There was no discussion, vote, or decision on the Biblical Canon at Nicaea.
@Gentle_brute And Christians had already been worshipping on Sundays since the FIRST Century.
None of these were new practices and none of them were pagan in origin.

Arianism cropped up in the late 3rd, early 4th Century. It was condemned at 2 local Synods in Alexandria before Nicaea.
@Gentle_brute And they believe this glorious first creation of God chose to be born as a human to save humanity.

The issue at Nicaea was whether Jesus was truly God or just the first &amp; greatest CREATION of God.

No one argued that he was "just a normal human being".
@Gentle_brute Christmas &amp; Easter had been celebrated for centuries before Nicaea. All they did was settle a dispute over the FORMULA for calculating the DATE of Easter.

Christians had been celebrating Easter since the 2nd Century, and Christmas since the early 3rd Century.
@Gentle_brute Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.
Notice there is literally NOTHING about them choosing the books of the Bible.

Because they didn't.

Read them for yourself.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@Gentle_brute Here's the History of how the Bible was canonized. It wasn't at Constantine or Nicaea or any single person or group.

It was a long process that started in the 1st Century &amp; continued well into the 5th Century.

https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@Gentle_brute Here's where the myth about Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible came from:
https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@Gentle_brute I've got the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

Read them yourself. There's NOTHING in there about taking books out of the Bible.

Nothing.

Because it didn't happen.
@Gentle_brute No sir, it is NOT a fact at all.
Maybe you should have actually READ those sources instead of just a screenshot.

The FACTS are that Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@Gentle_brute No, YOU are failing to realize that the Christian faith BEFORE the Council of Nicaea was IDENTICAL to the Christian faith AFTER Nicaea. 

The Council didn't introduce any new teachings of practices.

The Divinity of Christ had been taught from the beginning of our faith.
@Gentle_brute No, they DIDN'T change the Bible!
Seriously, they simply DIDN'T.

No, really, REALLY, they actually DIDN'T.

The issue of what books to include in the Bible BEVER EVEN CANE UP at Nicaea!

The Canon Laws (canon, not "cannon") were merely rules governing bishops.
@Gentle_brute Seriously, did you actually READ those sources you took pictures of?

None of the sources you have screenshots of support what you are saying. Read them

No evidence exists that the Council of Nicaea took books out of the Bible or even DISCUSSED what books to include in the Bible
@Gentle_brute Show me proof of ANY of this.

Where does it say they took books out of the Bible at Nicaea? Where does it say they even talked about what should be in the Bible AT ALL at Nicaea?

Where is the supporting documents that shows that ANYTHING you have said is true?
@Gentle_brute The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books would be in the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by Voltaire, popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread on the internet via memes &amp; Social Media.

It is not true.
@Gentle_brute Then how do YOU know?

You don't. You ASSUME.

Here are the Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

Read them yourself.
@Gentle_brute What Nicaea did was to DEFEND the belief in the Divinity of Christ and condemn the false teaching of Arianism.

Belief in the Divinity of Christ LONG preceded Nicaea. https://t.co/3wQ0bjTRtt
@Gentle_brute You are making assumptions. 
I've spent DECADES, nearly 30 yrs studying this period in minute detail. You are reading a single article from the Encyclopedia.
I've read the original source materials. The records of Nicaea &amp; the writings of the men who were actually THERE at Nicaea
@Geshti_Azadi @katoliii Also not true. Christmas &amp; Easter were being celebrated by Christians CENTURIES before Nicaea, and they are NOT of Pagan origins

https://t.co/jSBq0OFEhX
@Geshti_Azadi @katoliii This is NOT, in fact, an Historical fact.

Many of the men at Nicaea had just suffered through terrible persecution, resisting paganism. They would have rather DIED than compromise with paganism.

There's literally ZERO evidence that the Trinity is of pagan origins. Zero.
@GhettoActivist If I misunderstood you, I apologize.

What was the connection you were making, then, between when "Nicaea happened" and Gnosticism?

Please clarify.
@GhettoActivist The Council of Nicaea didn't deal with Gnosticism AT ALL.

The primary focus of the Council of Nicaea was the Arian Controversy regarding the condemned teachings of the Egyptian Presbyter Arius.

Gnosticism was simply NOT an issue the Council of Nicaea dealt with.
@GinaHollin @YouTube The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include in the Bible. That's an 18th century Myth started by Voltaire and popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.
Here's how the Bible ACTUALLY came to be...
https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@GingerJim5 Lots of Conspiracy Theories surrounding the Council of Nicaea.

I debunk many of those here:
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@GingerdeadM It's a common misconception and many Conspiracy Theories are built around misconceptions about the Council of Nicaea.
@GingerdeadM The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Canon of the Bible. It wasn't even an issue they dealt with at all.

https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@GrandsonTazz @alrightalona The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books would be deemed as Scripture.

In fact, the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up AT ALL at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi Also notice that I actually didn't quote the New Testament. I could have, since the Divinity of Christ is clearly taught in the NT.
But I quoted the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries who absolutely taught the Divinity of Christ LONG before Nicaea.
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi By the time Nicaea came along, most of the NT Canon had already been nearly universally accepted. Only a few books remained that were still being debated.

By the 2nd Century, the 4 Gospels, Acts, 13 Pauline Epistles, James, 1 Peter &amp; 1 John had been well established as Scripture
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi Follow this logic...THEY NEVER EVEN DISCUSSED WHAT BOOKS TO INCLUDE IN THE BIBLE **AT ALL** AT NICAEA!

And there were NO texts that suggested that Jesus was "a mere man". If you think THAT'S what the Gnostics thought, you need to study what the Gnostics ACTUALLY believed.
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi Here's the story of how the myth about the Council of Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible got started:
https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi Here's what ACTUALLY happened at Nicaea. Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi No, actually the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which texts to include in the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

It is an often repeated myth that was started in the 18th by Voltaire &amp; popularized by the novel The DaVinci Code.
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi The Council of Nicaea did NOT "elevate" Jesus from being merely human to being the Son of God.

He was proclaimed to be the Divine Son of God from the very beginning of the Christian faith. The New Testament &amp; the Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries all taught it. https://t.co/sDaqKyGI34
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi The books that were still being debated were:

Hebrews
2 Peter
Jude
2 &amp; 3 John
Revelation
Didache
1 Clement
Epistle of Barnabas
Gospel of Peter
Shepherd of Hermas

The Gnostic Gospels were never even under CONSIDERATION for inclusion in the Bible.

But Nicaea didn't decide this.
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi The existence of other factions within Christianity doesn't change the fact that the majority believed in the Divinity of Christ.

It proves that the teaching of the Divinity of Christ was NOT invented at Nicaea. It was DEFENDED at Nicaea as the pre-existing belief of the Church.
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi The fact is that the issue of the Biblical Canon was never even discussed at Nicaea, much less decided upon.

Voltaire's myth was picked up by Dan Brown, popularized in his novel, then spread on the internet via memes &amp; Social Media.

People often believe it without fact checking
@Gregory22848476 @pastorwf_kumuyi There is NO record or evidence that the subject of the Biblical Canon was even discussed at Nicaea, much less determined.

That is a very recent misconception mostly brought into the public awareness by the FICTIONAL novel The DaVinci Code.

This Conspiracy Theory spreads easily.

Dan Brown brought the Myth into the Popular consciousness and then it spread on the internet
@Griffingsw1 @Equanimity7772 The Christian Bible was NOT compiled at the Council of Nicaea.

That is a common misconception.
They never even discussed the matter much less decided on it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedfMGtq
@GummiPies @JCamachoLegal She's wrong, btw.

The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "writing" the Bible or choosing which books would be in the Bible.

Read the article she posted. It says absolutely NOTHING about it.

Because it didn't happen. 
Nicaea DIDN'T make the Bible
@GummiPies Here's the History of how the Bible was ACTUALLY canonized. (Hint: it WASN'T at the Council of Nicaea)

https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@GusHamilton12 @BillyGraham 3. Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea, who were ultimately condemned by the Council. But, ever the savvy politician, he backed the winning side in the end.
But he reneged on that support shortly after Nicaea &amp; started backing the Arians again.
@GusHamilton12 @BillyGraham Nothing you have said here is correct.
1. The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.
They never even discussed the matter much less decided on it.
2. No one was killed or assassinated as a result of the Council of Nicaea.
@HBCSGF There are a lot of false Conspiracy Theories circulating in the internet about the Council of Nicaea.
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@HLN_JesusLives @HavokHelena @thompsonb2569 Neither happened at Nicaea.
That is a popular myth. It didn't happen.

The Council of Nicaea did NOT compile or choose the books of the Bible. Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@HanyelPaulOkolo @femiaribisala You do know that Jesus had been preached for 300 yrs BEFORE Nicaea, right? 

We have extant copies of New Testament writings dating to 2nd or 3rd Century. We have the writings of the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries LONG before Nicaea.
@HarMegiddo @youngdonreborn Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not forming the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

They never even discussed the matter of the make-up of the Bible at Nicaea, much less decided it.
@HarMegiddo @youngdonreborn Two problems with that:
1. English didn't even EXIST as a language in the 4th Century during the Council of Nicaea. So they COULDN'T have "introduced the English name Jesus".
2. The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with editing or forming the Bible.
@HarionoStephen @PastorAmanat Here's a brief synopsis of what the Council of Nicaea DID do:

See any mention of them choosing the books of the Bible?

Me either.

Because they didn't.
@HarionoStephen @PastorAmanat I love it when people who clearly DON'T KNOW history, mock someone by saying "learn some history".😂

I have an advanced degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with creating the Bible. Nothing at all.
@HarionoStephen @PastorAmanat Oh, then, do please EdUcATe me.

Show your work.

Show me the sources of your information.

I can show you the original source materials from the Council of Nicaea itself.

I can show you scholarly sources from a dozen reputable historians and Biblical Scholars.
@HarionoStephen @PastorAmanat Show your work.

I've shown you mine.

Show me the evidence that the Council of Nicaea chose which books to include in or exclude from the Bible.

Show me ONE scholarly source that says so.

You CAN'T, because NONE do, because that whole narrative is an 18th Century MYTH.
@HarionoStephen @PastorAmanat The 18th Century philosopher, Voltaire, is the origin of the myth that Nicaea chose the Biblical Canon. 

That myth was seized on by the authors of the widely discredited book, "Holy Blood, Holy Grail", and then popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.
@HavokHelena @thompsonb2569 The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with writing or compiling the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
In fact the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob And you in fact DID say, "the Council of Nicea changed a lot of  the bible including the belief in reincarnation &amp; completely dumped the Goddess."

Which suggests that they BELIEVED in the Goddess before the Council of Nicaea "dumped" that belief.

You are wrong on all counts.
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob I am an Historian, and THAT is why I say that.

This is not merely a matter of BELIEF or opinion.
It is a matter of HISTORICAL RECORD.

Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the official records if all the decisions made by the Council.

Read them yourself
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob I have an advanced degree in History &amp; a Master's with a focus in Church History.

Here are several academic books on  the Biblical Canon and the Council of Nicaea.

NO Historian thinks that Nicaea chose the books of the Bible. Because they didn't.
https://t.co/tW96tPcfqs
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob I, on the other hand, have shown you PROOF in the form of both original source materials (the records of Nicaea) and numerous credible academic sources that confirm what Nicaea was about and what it WASN'T about.

No Goddess, no Reincarnation, no changing the Bible.

FACTS!
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob No, the Council of Nicaea actually DID NOT change ANY part of the Bible or make ANY decisions regarding it's contents. 

The subject of the Biblical Canon never even came up.

We have the actual records from Nicaea &amp; NO MENTION of any changes to the Bible. You are mistaken.
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with changing the Bible.

Also , never at ANY time was "the Goddess" or Reincarnation part of Christian beliefs OR the teachings of Jesus.

It wasn't "removed" from the Bible. It was never part of it to begin with.
@HazelMyHeart2 @BeatTheCult @FriendOfBob You have NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER for what you are claiming.

No evidence that Christians worshipped the Goddess before Nicaea.

No evidence that Christians believed in Reincarnation before Nicaea.

ZERO evidence that Nicaea changed the Bible.

Unsubstantiated Conspiracy Theories.
@Heart__Is__Home @markghost45 @TPBlue4 None of that is true.

The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "deciding what the Bible should say".

They never even DISCUSSED the issue of the Canon of the Bible at Nicaea, much less decided on it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the Bible.
@HedyLamarr0629 @RachelBitecofer First of all, NO ONE at the Council of Nicaea thought Jesus was just a human Prophet.

The Arians believed Jesus was the Son of God, the first and greatest creation of God, who existed before the world was made and who created the World.

They just didn't believe he was God.
@HedyLamarr0629 @RachelBitecofer Secondly, the Council of Nicaea did NOT write the Bible OR decide which books to include in the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

The issue of the Canon of the Bible never even came up for discussion at Nicaea, much less was decided on.
@HedyLamarr0629 @grcastleberry Christ was preached as Divine from the very beginning of the Christian faith, CENTURIES before Nicaea.

Nicaea didn't "vote" on his Divinity.
They DEFENDED &amp; CLARIFIED his Divinity against the heresy of Arianism. https://t.co/aZVZjjnwPb
@HeedWhoIs @robotoilchange @WasLuther @file_49 @JackPosobiec I didn't call them infallible.
I don't treat them as infallible.

But they ARE proof that Christianity existed for 300 yrs BEFORE Nicaea.

Nor did I suggest that belonging to a particular denomination would save anyone.

@HeyLannyCamden Agree with all of this.
And Gnosticism was one of the major issues in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries.

But at Nicaea, the primary focus was ARIANISM, not Gnosticism.
In fact, there's no evidence they even DISCUSSED Gnosticism at Nicaea.

Arianism was the WHOLE REASON for the Council.
@HeyLannyCamden Here's the Encyclopedia Brittanica on the Council of Nicaea.
Read it. It will makes ZERO mention if Gnosticism. Because Gnosticism was NOT an issue at Nicaea.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@HeyLannyCamden Look, I have an advanced degree in History and a Master's in Church History. I've studied this for the past 25 yrs.

Here are the ACTUAL CANONS of the Council of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.
https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@HeyLannyCamden Read the writings of the Church Fathers who were actually THERE at Nicaea. None of them mentions the Council dealing with Gnosticism or choosing the books of the Bible.

It was about ARIANISM!
That was the whole reason the Council was called.
@HeyLannyCamden That link includes the 20 Canons of Nicaea (mostly dealing with rules for Bishops), the original text of the Nicene Creed (later amended by the Council of Constantinople 381AD), &amp; the Synodal Letter sent to every diocese of the Church.

No mention of Gnosticism or the Bible.
@HeyLannyCamden Yep. And Gnosticism was a major issue in the Church during the latter half of the 2nd Century through the 3rd Century.
But that controversy waned and then came the rise of Arianism in the early 4th Century.
Nicaea was called to confront the Arian Controversy...NOT Gnosticism.
@HeyLannyCamden Yes, but the Council of Nicaea DID NOT DEAL WITH GNOSTICISM. 

The primary focus of Nicaea was dealing with ARIANISM!
Gnosticism was not even on the agenda at Nicaea.
Neither was choosing the books of the Bible.
@HolcombeK11 @noah_nonsense @mikeyB2025 Try the actual Canons of the Council of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council. There are 20 of them. Not one mention of voting in what books to include in the Bible.

Or the writings of the Church Fathers who were actually THERE at Nicaea. No mention of
@HolcombeK11 @noah_nonsense @mikeyB2025 it from them either. Here, you can read the Canons of Nicaea I for yourself.

Also included is the original text of the Nicene Creed (the modern Creed recited in churches today is the Creed as amended by the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD)
https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@HornsbyLewis @olutobi_joshua @Johanne43036983 @_Zac_Langdon_ And here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of all the official decisions made by the Council in 325 AD.

https://t.co/H3KvZmzAL9

Not one mention of choosing the books of the Bible.

Because they didn't.
@HornsbyLewis @olutobi_joshua @Johanne43036983 @_Zac_Langdon_ I can prove it.

The Council of Nicaea literally had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, then spread via memes &amp; SM.
@HowSxGotScrewed Constantine did no such of a thing!
Nor did the Council of Nicaea.

Constantine issues the Edict of Milan, in 313 AD, which granted Religious tolerance for ALL religions, including Christianity, officially ending the Roman Persecutions of Christians.
@HugoHouse7 Here's the actual History of how the Bible came to be.
And it's not how you probably think.
It wasn't at the Council of Nicaea. They had nothing at all to do with it.
It was a PROCESS not an event.
https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@HumanSonOfGod @YouTube No one at the Council of Nicaea thought Jesus was a mere human being, or prophet.

Both sides believed he was the Divine Son of God.

The disagreement was over HOW Divine he was. The Arians believed he was the first &amp; greatest creation of God, like God in many ways, but not God.
@HumanSonOfGod @YouTube No one there, however, believed or argued that Jesus was merely a human Prophet.

Also, the belief in Jesus' Divinity LONG predated Nicaea. The Early Church Fathers from the 1sr, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries all taught that Jesus was Divine. https://t.co/VRKMD8Daqf
@HuskerT2 Actually, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be excluded.

Nothing about the Bible there either

@JOECIOLINOSR @Mexh__ @bilgilimehmet1 @historyinmemes @elonmusk @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 275 AD.

@Jayson_Carmona_ @Stephen_Agnew @Raw_Vegas @KatelynTweeter Yes, the precise Theological terminology did develop over time, though the ideas and beliefs described by these terms long predates even Nicaea.

Theological controversy required greater specificity and precision in terminology. These Councils hashed out the terms we now use.
@Jbarnum78 @GSnow_42 @30calKyle @LadyHeather_L @JennaEllisEsq The Council of Nicaea never even discussed the Biblical Canon, much less decided on which books to include.

@Jbarnum78 @GSnow_42 @30calKyle @LadyHeather_L @JennaEllisEsq The TERM homoousios was first applied to the Trinity at Nicaea.

Belief in the Trinity LONG preceded Nicaea.

Nicaea used the term homoousios to CLARIFY what was MEANT by Christ's Divinity.

Christ was preached as Divine from the beginning. https://t.co/FuPx3yM0lU
@Jbarnum78 @GSnow_42 @30calKyle @LadyHeather_L @JennaEllisEsq The term "homoousios" was used at Nicaea to affirm and CLARIFY what had been taught from the 1st Century forward, the true and full Deity of Christ.

It was taught by the Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries. https://t.co/UTjYMYlMUg
@Jeanthejust @jilevin Not one thing you said there is correct.
Not only did Constantine not turn Jesus into a "Sun God", but Constantine actually favored the ARIANS (who DENIED the Divinity of Christ) in the lead up to Nicaea, and the Council went AGAINST his wishes. Ever a savvy politician, he backed
@Jeanthejust @jilevin Shortly after Nicaea, Constantine reneged on his support for the Niceans, and brought the Arians back from exile. He made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor.
At Eusebius' urging, he began persecuting Nicene bishops deposing them and
@Jeanthejust @jilevin replacing them with Arian bishops in key cities throughout the Empire.

After his death, his sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, continued his policies.

Arianism actually GREW in power in the years after Nicaea. It took another 56 yrs &amp; another Church Council to defeat Arianism.
@Jeanthejust @jilevin winning side, even agreeing to exile any bishop who refused to sign the Nicene Creed.

Constantine suggested a compromise wording to the Creed (homoiousios--of SIMILAR nature to the Father) but the Council went with wording the Arians could NOT accept, (homoousios--SAME Nature).
@Jenn_Leah13 @BCoIe_ @CardinalChaos2 @TheSkeptic4122 The Divinity of Christ was believed and preached from the very beginning of the Christian faith. It wasn't "granted" by the Council of Nicaea. It was DEFENDED &amp; CLARIFIED at Nicaea.

@Jennife49007628 @ArizonaCrusader 1st, the Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD. That's NOT "over 1000 years later".

2nd, the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T "create the Bible" or have ANYTHING at all to do with choosing what books would be in the Bible.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible
@Jennife49007628 @ArizonaCrusader Except, as I said, they DIDN'T decide which books would be included in the Bible at Nicaea. They DIDN'T.
Didn't even DISCUSS that issue.

And we know what the Bible said before then because we have HUNDREDS of manuscripts dating to the 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, long before Nicaea.

No one was executed as a result of Nicaea. In fact, Emperor Constantine ended up supporting the ARIANS after Nicaea, the ones who LOST at Nicaea!
@JerryMcPhers @IndySwingVoter @the_meghaning The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with this issue, nor with determining the content of the Bible.

@Joe_Cupolo_ Christians had been worshipping on Sundays since the 1st Century.

Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea changed the day of worship for Christians.

Read the article above. I present all of the evidence that you need.
 Here's the relevant parts: https://t.co/Bf280zADA8
@Joe_Cupolo_ No one was slaughtered as a result of the Council of Nicaea.

The few Bishops who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were exiled from the Empire, not imprisoned or executed.

And Constantine rescinded their exile after only 2 short yrs.

No one was executed after Nicaea.
@Joe_Cupolo_ No. But I have read the writings of those who were there.

@John_Hess17 @meggy_harper @HarmonicBalanc3 @Reservoirdogz76 @Chayenn72766251 Yes, this is spelled out in the 6th Canon of Nicaea.

We have the testimony of the Scriptures and of the Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries long before Constantine or Nicaea.

Christianity was in existence for 300 yrs before the Council of Nicaea
@Kenneth73669984 @TalbertSwan Jesus was preached for 300 yrs BEFORE Constantine &amp; the Council of Nicaea, so, no, that isn't true.
@Kenneth73669984 @TalbertSwan Nope. He was preached and proclaimed for 300 years before Nicaea. We have the witness of the New Testament &amp; the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries.

Nicaea did NOT invent Jesus.
@Kenneth73669984 @TalbertSwan You haven't done anything yourself except make wild accusations and unsubstantiated Conspiracy Theories.

I have provided you evidence, direct proof that Jesus was proclaimed for 300 yrs BEFORE Nicaea, and all you have is memes &amp; emojis in response.

It is clear you know nothing

@KenteGlizzy @jakem7992 @ltd_rep @TheBigAristotl1 @900Chupacabra @666mami_ @CleSportOpinion @PetarMilan2 @HaterMuse The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T remove any books from the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

In fact, the issue of what books to include in the Bible NEVER EVEN CAME UP at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.

@KerryBird1234 @lizard_komodo @DickWee41519092 @miss_chief1000 @StopAntisemites @from Christianity existed, as my quotes from 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Century CHRISTIAN leaders proves, for 300 years BEFORE Nicaea.

And those few people who were exiled for not signing the Creed were brought back after 2 short yrs because Constantine preferred the ARIANS all along.
@KerryBird1234 @lizard_komodo @DickWee41519092 @miss_chief1000 @StopAntisemites @from First of all, the Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not "400 yrs later".

2nd, the Early Christians ABSOLUTELY believed in the Divinity of Christ.
It was taught and believed by the Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries. His Divinity was proclaimed from the beginning https://t.co/hMfC1GEfrT
@KerryBird1234 @lizard_komodo @DickWee41519092 @miss_chief1000 @StopAntisemites @from He was partial to the Arians before Nicaea, influenced by his sister, Flavia Constantia, an Arian sympathizer &amp; his advisor, Eusebius of Nicomedia, a key ally of Arius.

But when the Council turned against Arius, Constantine, ever the savvy politician, he backed the winning side.
@KerryBird1234 @lizard_komodo @DickWee41519092 @miss_chief1000 @StopAntisemites @from No one was murdered as a result of Nicaea. No one.

No major tenets of Christianity were invented at Nicaea. None. 

No books removed from the Bible &amp; burned. None.

You don't have to believe the message of Christianity. But you should not misrepresent our DOCUMENTED HISTORY.
@KerryBird1234 @lizard_komodo @DickWee41519092 @miss_chief1000 @StopAntisemites @from No. It wasn't "determined" there,but was DEFENDED there against Arianism. I have already demonstrated that the belief in Christ's Divinity did not ORIGINATE from Nicaea, but long preceded it.
They DEFENDED it against the 4th Century false teaching of Arius of Alexandria.
@KerryBird1234 @lizard_komodo @DickWee41519092 @miss_chief1000 @StopAntisemites @from That was a blatantly anti-Semitic claim, and I reject it.

I am not here to support that ridiculous and awful claim, but to correct historical inaccuracies regarding the Council of Nicaea, and the origins of Christianity.

@Khelevaster_ @JonathanOladipo @JamieDominy1 @EnithTea @TKoobaan @BeatTheCult In reality, the Council of Nicaea never even DISCUSSED the matter of the content of the Biblical Canon, much less decided on it.

It simply didn't happen.

@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG I have an advanced degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

I suggest YOU learn history somewhere other than memes and FB posts.

I have studied the actual Historical records of Nicaea. I have read the writings of those who were actually THERE at Nicaea.
@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG Maybe you need to take all of those 2 cents, add them together, and actually BUY A BOOK about the history of the Council of Nicaea.

Because the info you have on it is the worst kind of pseudo-hustiry Conspiracy Theories that no actual historian believes is true.
@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG Read your own post. 
Not ONE thing in there indicates that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

Read it yourself. It's NOT in there!

Here's a better article from the Encyclopedia Brittanica that goes into even more detail.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG THE ACTUAL Council of Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy which threatened to split the Church.

It resulted in the condemnation of the Presbyter Arius, the Nicene Creed, which condemned and corrected his teachings, and some rules governing bishops.

Nothing about the Bible.
@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with creating the Bible or choosing which books to include in the Bible.

@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG The Council of Nicaea wasn't a Myth. It actually happened.

The Myth was when you claimed that what they DID at the Council of Nicaea was to pick the books of the Bible.

That's NOT what they did at the Council of Nicaea. THAT part is the Myth.

Quit playing games.
I'm done.
@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG The Council of Nicaea wasn't the myth. The Council of Nicaea actually happened in 325 AD

The idea that the Council **picked the books of the Bible** WAS a myth invented by Voltaire in the 18th Century.

So, yeah... clearly reading comprehension is a problem with you.
@KleinhausStoll @RepMTG Ummmm...I never said that. Like, AT ALL.

I said that the idea that the Council of Nicaea PICKED THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE was an 18th century myth (invented by Voltaire) and that Dan Brown POPULARIZED it by including it in his novel.

Maybe reading comprehension is a problem here?
@KlingonHousing I'm as against Christian Nationalism as you are.

Don't go mistaking those jacklegs for the ENTIRE Christian Religion.

And don't go mistaking pseudo-history you got from some memes on Facebook for ACTUAL History.

Nicaea was nothing like what you imagine it was.
@KlingonHousing Mmmkay.

If by that you mean Christianity, it began 300 yrs BEFORE Nicaea in 33 AD.
@KlingonHousing What is it that you think happened at Nicaea?
@Knightmare6 @TheNevilleNicol @stopalready23 @joncoopertweets Actually, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be excluded.

He reneged on his support for the Trinitarians shortly after Nicaea. He attempted to shape the Church into an Arian Religion, and he failed.

@LaurenBrns @JesterWootton No one at all was murdered or executed as a result of the Council of Nicaea. No one.

A handful of Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were exiled.

But a short 2 yrs later, they were brought back after Constantine rescinded their exile.

@Linda__Stevens @LALewman In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power and influence after Nicaea because of the intervention of Constantine and his sons. Only their own untimely deaths in battle prevented them from completely transforming Christianity into an Arian Religion.

But Constantine rescinded their exile a short 2 yrs later. He brought them back and even made the lead Arian
@Linda__Stevens @LALewman The Doctrine of the Trinity LONG predated the Council of Nicaea.

@LuminousLaurenM @yhtak539 @MockWooloo @dh4onethingonly In fact, the Canon of the Bible wasn't fully settled for another Century after Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea never discussed, voted, or decided ANYTHING about which books to include in the Bible.

It wasn't an event, it was a process that spanned nearly 500 yrs.
@LuminousLaurenM @yhtak539 @MockWooloo @dh4onethingonly Oh, and guess what?

It wasn't the Council of Nicaea that did it. It wasn't ANY single Church Council, pope, or bishop. It wasn't an event. It was a gradual PROCESS that took nearly 500yrs
@MS_ZORRo77 @280_Cjd @colbertlateshow records of the decisions that were made by that Council, the 20 Canons of Nicaea. They DIDN'T decide the content of the Bible.

We also have the written evidence of the process by which the Bible was Canonized. And that evidence points to a long process, not an event.
@MTCicero2 @mariewalsh18 @GenIsSolo Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council (with no objectionable commentary, just the actual Historical documents)

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

Nothing at all in there about choosing the Books of the Bible.
@MTCicero2 @mariewalsh18 @GenIsSolo Historian and Biblical Scholar Bart Ehrman, has written at length about the Canonization of Scripture, and debunked the myths about the Council of Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible.

https://t.co/LsTVO5RGTr
@MTCicero2 @mariewalsh18 @GenIsSolo The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the Books of the Bible.

That story you referred to is a Myth. No such thing ever happened at Nicaea.

The Canon of the Bible was not even an issue at Nicaea.
They dealt with the Arian Controversy.
@MTakundamuvengi @Loyal_ex_24 @tygertigz_hbk @CeedeZakingi The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books would be included in the Bible.

That is a modern myth invented in the 18th century and popularized in recent times by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@MaaTchaKhun @highvibe20 The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with Gnosticism.

Nicaea was about the ARIAN Controversy, NOT Gnosticism.

Gnosticism wasn't even an issue at Nicaea.
@MacTrolling @CampCat953 @PrblyNoteWorthy @BeingJWood So, no, most Christians before Nicaea would NOT have been Gnostics. Very, very few would have been.

And the Gnostics WANTED it that way. 

They were a very exclusive, elite, secret society of those few "in the know" (the Greek word "gnosis" means "knowledge")
@MacTrolling @CampCat953 @PrblyNoteWorthy @BeingJWood You know NONE of what you said in this post is historically accurate, right?

The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining the Canon of the Bible. The matter never even came up for DISCUSSION at Nicaea, much less a vote.

Nicaea was about Arianism.
@MacrossMX @romanhistory1 It wasn't Constantine OR the Council of Nicaea that "paved the way for the Great Schism". It was the Council of Toledo in 589 AD that inserted the fateful phrase "and the Son" ("Filioque" in Latin) into the Nicene Creed. This unilateral insertion of the Filioque is the culprit.
@MadBastard_v2 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books would be included in the Bible.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@MadHatterLTN @Innocen56475850 @yomarkjean Certainly it did!
In fact, the term "Trinity" itself was coined 150 years BEFORE Nicaea.
@MadTheo096 @Bro89290681 @ugroyp @MaroneBoderato Both Christmas and Easter predated Nicaea by centuries.

Nicaea didn't invent or impose either celebration.

Easter (Pascha) celebrations date to the 2nd Century.

Christmas celebrations date to the 3rd Century.
@MadTheo096 @Bro89290681 @ugroyp @MaroneBoderato But again, he was WRONG about it entirely.

The Canonization of the Bible DID NOT take place at Nicaea. It wasn't even an issue that the Council even dealt with.

The Canonization of the Bible was w long PROCESS, not an event, spanning nearly 500 yrs. 

https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@MadTheo096 @Bro89290681 @ugroyp @MaroneBoderato No the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with selecting the books of the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, and popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@MadTheo096 @Bro89290681 @ugroyp @MaroneBoderato No. 90% of the time was spent on debating the Arian Controversy and coming up with the wording of the Nicene Creed.

They didn't set the date for Christmas. Didn't even discuss it.

But they did resolve a dispute over the formula for calculating the date of Easter.
@MagaBulldog @Gods_WarriorUSA The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining the makeup of the Bible.

It's not true
@ManigoRicky @TalbertSwan Council of Nicaea did NOT create the Bible or have ANYTHING to do with determining it's contents.

That is an 18th Century Myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code and spread on the internet by memes and Conspiracy Theorists. 
It is NOT true.
@MarcEngland8 @Nt_bowser @_Amarican And we have actual PHYSICAL PROOF that the Bible was not written at Nicaea. We have manuscripts dating to the 2nd &amp; 3rd Century, LONG before Nicaea.
We have the records from Nicaea, showing that the Canon of the Bible was NOT among the issues they dealt with. Historical facts.
@MarcEngland8 @Nt_bowser @_Amarican None of this proves that our beliefs are true. These are merely evidence of the History of Christianity as a Religion.

But they demonstrate conclusively that the narrative that Christianity or the Bible was created at the Council of Nicaea is a FALSE Conspiracy Theory.
@MarcEngland8 @Nt_bowser @_Amarican We have the writings if the early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries affirming belief in the Divinity of Christ.

Again, whether you personally believe in Christ's Divinity or not is irrelevant. The point is that the belief WAS NOT invented at Nicaea. https://t.co/bp0am9Mq3v
@MarcusTriton @khessel Also, Enoch IS part of the Biblical Canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

But the Council of Nicaea had nothing at all to do with that, and neither did Constantine.

Nicaea was about addressing the Arian Controversy, NOT assembling the Bible.
@MarcusTriton @khessel Here's the ACTUAL Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.
Nothing about choosing the books of the Bible anywhere in there.
https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@MarcusTriton @khessel Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with excluding Enoch from the Bible.

Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That's an 18th century myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code
@MarcusTriton @khessel The issue of what books to include in or exclude from the Bible never even came up at the Council of Nicaea.

That's a myth started by the 18th Century philosopher Voltaire. Dan Brown seized on it for his book &amp; movie then it went viral on SM via memes &amp; conspiracy theory posts.
@Marcy_Powell @spicy_halfanese The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "compiling" the Bible.

They never even discussed the matter.

@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn 3. Invent the Trinity. The Doctrine of the Trinity long predates the Council of Nicaea &amp; Constantine. Constantine himself, actually favored the ARIAN, who denied the Divinity of Christ, in the lead up to Nicaea, so he could NOT have been the source of the Trinity concept.
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn It was NOT "a construct of Constantine".

Here's what ACTUALLY happened at Nicaea.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn Other things that Constantine &amp; the Council of Nicaea DIDN'T do:

1. invent Easter &amp; Christmas. Both of these CHRISTIAN (not pagan) celebrations date back CENTURIES before Nicaea.

2. Change the Sabbath day from Saturday to Sunday. Christians had been worshipping on Sundays since
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Biblical Canon.

The issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea. They never even discussed it, much less decided it.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy.
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn The Council of Nicaea was about resolving the Arian Controversy sparked by an Egyptian Priest named Arius who denied the Divinity of Christ in contradiction of Scripture &amp; Church teaching. (Belief in the Divinity of Christ long preceded Nicaea, dating to the 1st Century)
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn The Council ruled against Arius (whom Constantine had initially supported), drafting the original version of the Nicene Creed (later to be amended to the current form at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD)
They also resolved a dispute over how to calculate the date of Easter
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn Then it should be no great shocker that he is responsible for this oft-memed urban legend.

It isn't true.

The fact is that the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea. They never even discussed it, much less decided on it.

Constantine had nothing to do with it
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn They also made some general rules governing bishops. 

Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council:

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

Notice there's absolutely NO mention of choosing the books of the Bible.

Because they didn't.
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn Yes, please, do look into it.

You will find that the whole Narrative about Constantine and the Council of Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible is a an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized by The DaVinci Code. (Which then spread via memes &amp; SM)
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn the 1st Century because, according to ALL 4 Gospels, Jesus rose from the Dead on the "first day of the week", Sunday. 
The practice of Sunday worship is attested to by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, LONG before Nicaea.
@MarketingMakerz @soulatonement @sundressfascist And the SECOND Council of Nicaea was in 787 AD, and THEY didn't deal with the Bible either.

Nicaea II was about the Iconoclast Controversy and whether it was permissable to use Icons as objects of veneration and meditation in Christian prayer &amp; worship.
https://t.co/RIX2YBpHUy

That's a common misconception.
@Markvetter13 @JMcpherrin @realchloenicole The Council of Nicaea was about dealing with the Arian Controversy, not assembling the Bible.

The question of what books should be in the Bible wasn't even on the agenda at Nicaea.

Nowhere in there does it say that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

Go back and read it yourself. It doesn't say it anywhere.

Nicaea was about ARIANISM.

@MarlishGambino @Sunkissed2181 @Promo4Purpose @OfficiallyIce Here is the real story about how the Bible was canonized and compiled. It wasn't a single event, but a long process that began in the 1st Century &amp; continued into the 5th Century. And Nicaea had nothing to do with it.

In fact, the issue of the Canon of the Bible NEVER EVEN CAME UP at Nicaea, much less was decided there.
@MarlishGambino @Sunkissed2181 @Promo4Purpose @OfficiallyIce The Council of Nicaea was called to resolve the Arian Controversy. They also settled a dispute over how to calculate the date of Easter &amp; they drew up rules governing Bishops.

They never even DISCUSSED what books to include in the Bible, much less decided anything about it.
@MartinMaola @SeptembersRain There were no books "kicked out of the Bible" at Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in the Bible.
@MaryWannaGame Correct, they attempted to settle the dispute, and they did for MOST churches, but some continued to use the older formula that was the 1st Sunday after 14 Nissan (Passover). The Controversy continued for several more years after Nicaea, but eventually settled on one formula.
@MaryWannaGame Easter (Pascha) was a Christian celebration from the 2nd Century onward. It doesn't have ANY connection to paganism.
The Council of Nicaea helped resolve a conflict over 2 competing formulas for calculating the date of Easter. But the Holy Day celebration dates to the 2nd Century

@MaxF8294 It literally was not.
In fact, even the term "Trinity" was coined over 150 yrs before Nicaea.

How could they come up with a term in the 2nd Century for a doctrine that wouldn't exist until the 4th Century?🤔
@MaxF8294 Since the Trinity has essentially been taught from the very beginning of the Christian faith (it was NOT "invented" at the Council of Nicaea, but LONG predated Nicaea) that's kind of hard to buy.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about resolving the Arian Controversy, NOT setting the Canon of Scripture.
@MelusiMapholisa @Amen_Baba_ Athanasius of Alexandria, the champion of Nicene Theology at the Council of Nicaea, was in fact a black African, and the archbishop and Patriarch of the Church of Alexandria.
@MelusiMapholisa @Amen_Baba_ Ummmm, the chief proponent of Nicene Theology was Athanasius of Alexandria, who was in fact the BLACK AFRICAN archbishop of the See of Alexandria, Egypt.

Alexander of Alexandria, and the Presbyter Arius were also both from Africa.

@MetzUAC1530 So also, those who claim that the Council of Nicaea and the Emperor Constantine "chose what books would be in the Bible" also clearly know NOTHING about History.

This is non-historical FICTION, a modern Conspiracy Theory popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.
@MiekWeek @1DoctorPoison @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta Also, the apriori belief of the Christian faith WAS the Deity of Christ. It was believed from the 1st Century forward. Arianism actually didn't arise until the late 3rd, early 4th Century.

That is why it was condemned at the early Synods in Alexandria and ultimately at Nicaea.
@MiekWeek @1DoctorPoison @anointedqueen__ @azealia_wig @DrDomPimenta But the controversy grew and became a major distraction in the Church.

Eusebius urged Constantine to call a general Church Council to resolve the dispute. That is why the Council of Nicaea was called.

It was never anywhere NEAR half. Arianism was ALWAYS a minority movement.
@MikeGal47438029 @edcski19722 @outsidegang @ACTBrigitte Perhaps you should as well.

@MikeParks75 @WriterWa @AnalystHealth @bluskabucknut @NoahPaulLeGies @GingerGinGauche @Pythonette @JohnFugelsang You are certainly welcome to your own opinions, but you are not welcome to your own facts.

The Council of Nicaea did NOT, in fact, select the CANON (one "n") of the Bible.

They didn't even DISCUSS the matter, much less "cherry-pick" among the Gospels.

Gnosticism had been primarily dealt with BEFORE Nicaea without needing a Church Council to address it. It would creep up again a few more times, but each time, it was rejected.

@MythosMayhem @musicmankev @masonmennenga After that, he began deposing Nicene bishops and replacing them with Arian bishops in key Sees throughout the Empire. After his death, his sons, Constans and Constantius II, continued his policy of enforced Arianization.

Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea.
@MythosMayhem @musicmankev @masonmennenga It was Eusebius of Nicomedia, interceding on behalf of Arius, who encouraged Constantine to call the Council of Nicaea.

Arius had been condemned at 2 local Synods in Alexandria. Nicaea was kind if an "appeal" to a higher court for Arius.
@MythosMayhem @musicmankev @masonmennenga No, actually, Constantine favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.

He only backed the Niceans once it became clear that the Council had turned solidify against Arius.

He then reneged on that support a few yrs after Nicaea and supported the Arians again.
@MythosMayhem @musicmankev @masonmennenga No. In the lead up to Nicaea, he was influenced by his sister, Flavia, who was an Arian sympathizer, and Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was an  ally of Arius.

He only backed the "Homoousian" side after it became clear that the Council had turned solidly against Arius.
@MythosMayhem @musicmankev @masonmennenga The Council of Constantinople confirmed the decisions of Nicaea and expanded on the Nicene Creed, finally defeating Arianism within the Empire.

Arianism flourished for several more Centuries outside the Empire in the Germanic Barbarian tribes in the West.
@NH3Crypto @AccountantInc The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with "deciding which texts to keep and which to throw out" of the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread via memes &amp; Social Media.
@NSWCHARLIEHERU 1. Serapis isn't Jesus. (It's a modern day myth)
2. Jesus wasn't white.
3. Literally NO ONE at the Council of Nicaea was White!
4. The Council of Nicaea DIDN'T create Jesus much less a "White Jesus".

Read ACTUAL History not Conspiracy Theories.

@NateoftheNorth @Hedzer15 @DavidKayumba11 @phantomhitch @AAgather I have a BA in history and a master's degree with a focus on church history. I have read the original writings of the people who were actually at Nicaea. Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius of Alexandria, Arius, Eusebius of Caesarea, and even Constantine himself.
@NateoftheNorth @Hedzer15 @DavidKayumba11 @phantomhitch @AAgather I have read all of the canons of Nicaea. There is no mention whatsoever of any discussion, vote, or decision on which books to include in the Bible.

The Council of Nicaea focused primarily on the Arian controversy, and settling some other minor disputes in the Church.
@NateoftheNorth @Hedzer15 @DavidKayumba11 @phantomhitch @AAgather The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include in the Bible.

@NateoftheNorth @Hedzer15 @DavidKayumba11 @phantomhitch @AAgather The Council of Nicaea used the scriptures which were recognized before their time. The canonization of the Bible was not an event but I process That took nearly 500 years and the Council of Nicaea did not decide which books to include in the Bible.
@NateoftheNorth @Hedzer15 @DavidKayumba11 @phantomhitch @AAgather You understand that the Council of Nicaea literally had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books would be included in the Bible, right?

That's a modern Conspiracy Theory popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

It never happened.
They never even DISCUSSED it.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians Constantine didn't control the Council, and in fact, he actually backed the ARIANS, who were ultimately CONDEMNED at Nicaea. He ended up backing the winning side only AFTER the Council turned against Arius from the very first session.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians Constantine initially favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. He was influenced by Eusebius and by his own sister, Flavia, who was an Arian sympathizer.

Constantine felt that Arianism was easier to explain and easier for former pagans to accept.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians It's not my opinion. It's Historical FACT.

HERE are the Canons of the Council of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.
https://t.co/HtxWQ5eXxY

Read them yourself. NOTHING in there about choosing the books of the Bible.

You have ZERO evidence.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians Jesus was worshipped as Divine LONG before Nicaea. The New Testament teaches that Jesus was God Incarnate. The Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries said he was God Incarnate.

Belief in the Deity of Christ was not "Invented" at Nicaea, it was DEFENDED.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians None of this is true.

The Council of Nicaea was set to resolve an AFRICAN Controversy that began in Alexandria, Egypt, and was led by the BLACK AFRICAN Patriarch of Alexandria, St. Athanasius. There were NO Europeans there except a couple of Legates from Rome.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians Nope. Nothing was created at Nicaea. No new beliefs were added that weren't part of the Christian faith for 300 yrs before that.

Thus is an entirely false Narrative.
@NaughtySofa @imhmikaelson @Pickinmyfro @Jesus_III_ @DrakeOfLesbians The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

The matter of the Canon of Scripture was NOT decided at Nicaea, or even discussed.

It was about resolving the Arian Controversy not determining the Bible.
@NicoleL51476898 @EmilyWa37119317 And no one was imprisoned or beheaded after Nicaea. No one.

The few Bishops who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were exiled, that's all.

But Constantine rescinded the exile after 2 short yrs &amp; he made the lead Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia his personal Spiritual Advisor.
@NicoleL51476898 @EmilyWa37119317 First of all, nope. Not true.

Secondly, The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 342 AD. 

Seriously. Google is free. 🙄
@NicoleL51476898 @EmilyWa37119317 Here's the actual Canons of Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the books of the Bible.
@NicoleL51476898 @EmilyWa37119317 No, my friend.

I have studied the Council of Nicaea for 30 yrs.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining the Canon of the Bible.
@NicoleL51476898 @EmilyWa37119317 No, the term is found in the Hebrew Scriptures as well as the New Testament LONG before Nicaea.
@NicoleL51476898 @EmilyWa37119317 The fact is that Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. Yet the Council ruled AGAINST the Arians.

Constantine, ever the savvy politician, backed the winning side.
But then he reneged on that support a few yrs later &amp; started supporting the Arians again

@NtchurSobek @lone_rides In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea.

Because Constantine, who had always been sympathetic to the Arian position, reneged on his support for Nicene Christianity &amp; began persecuting Nicene bishops, deposing them &amp; replacing them with Arian bishops.
@NtchurSobek @lone_rides No one was killed after Nicaea, not even the ones who refused to sign the Creed.

They were exiled from the Empire.
And after only 2 yrs, Constantine rescinded their exile and brought them back, making the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor.
@NuclearOrpheus @IamLewisU @The_Hellenist If you had actually DONE some Historiography, you would know that the Council of Nicaea was NOT called for either of those reasons.

They DIDN'T pick the books of the Bible (that is an 18th century myth started by Voltaire) &amp; they DIDN'T make Christianity the State Religion.
@NuclearOrpheus @IamLewisU @The_Hellenist The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible. The issue never even came up at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.

And Christianity didn't become the State Religion until 380 AD under Theodosius I.
@OG_Trump_Monkey @WasLuther @SammyJo71 @JackPosobiec Also, the Dead Sea Scrolls PREDATED Christianity by Centuries, and LONG predates Nicaea by nearly 600 yrs.

They were produced sometime in the 3rd Century BC by a community of Essenes, an Apocalyptic JEWISH sect that existed long before Christianity.

So, NONE of that is true.
@OG_Trump_Monkey @WasLuther @SammyJo71 @JackPosobiec Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

Show me, please, where it says they "assembled the Bible".

I'll give you a hint...it doesn't.
@ObsFromLife @ZacPac Bishops. He started deposing Nicene bishops in key Sees throughout the Empire, replacing them with Arian bishops.
After his death, his sons, Constans and Constantius II, continued this policy of enforced Arianization.
He deposed Athanasius of Alexandria no fewer than FIVE TIMES!
@ObsFromLife @ZacPac In fact, in the 56 yrs after Nicaea, Arianism actually GREW in power &amp; influence, prompting St Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

It took another Church Council, calked by pro-Nicene Emperor Theodosius I, in 381AD to

However, it continued to thrive in the Germanic tribes outside the Empire, among the Goths, Langobards &amp; Vandals for several more Centuries.

By the 8th Century, however, most of these tribes eventually accepted Nicene orthodoxy.

@OceanAteMyPhone @JamesTanksley13 @passionate61 @rbisrb I wasn't arguing for any of that.

The Divine Inspiration of the Bible is a matter of FAITH.

But the history of the Council of Nicaea &amp; the process of the Canonization of the Bible are matters of Historical record.

I was correcting widespread misinformation about that.
@OfNicea 
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@OgbeniDemola I'm sorry, my friend, but none of that is Historically accurate.
The Council of Nicaea had NOTHING at all to do with "putting the Bible together".
And the Bible existed LONG before 1516.
Here's the ACTUAL History of how the Bible came to be...
https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@OlY3llo @NoHolyScripture The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T establish Christianity as the State Religion.

The Edict of Milan in 313 AD granted Religious TOLERATION to all religions, including Christianity, ending 300 yrs of Persecution.

Christianity wouldn't become the State Religion until 380 AD.
@OldSchoolGlitch @0ccultbot The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD and had NOTHING to do with the Bible.

The King James Version was translated in 1611 AD, and WASN'T "forced at sword point on the masses".

So you are not only wrong on all fronts, but have demonstrated your total ignorance of basic history.
@OpusFluke @Beermunster @amandalitman Probably because the Council of Nicaea had literally NOTHING to do with writing or choosing the books of the Bible.

That's a common misconception.
The Council of Nicaea never even discussed the matter.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not defining the Bible.
@Orvold42 @r_graus @InfiDale3476 You didn't know it because it ISN'T actually true.

It isn't true.

Here are the actual records from Nicaea itself, the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmhrx1

NOTHING about the Bible!
@OurStorynLegacy @Phyllia12 None of these books were REMOVED from the Bible at Nicaea

These are all still part of the Catholic Bible--except for Enoch, which never WAS part of the Bible. Only the Ethiopian Orthodox Church ever included it in the Canon. And it is STILL part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Canon.
@OurStorynLegacy @Phyllia12 You apparently have never read the Catholic Bible or seen the Eastern Orthodox Bible. 

The additional chapters of Esther are IN THERE.

@PolyPanTransMan @zanografix @DMMeeble @alan_bramley @womensmarch No sir, with respect, the Council of Nicaea had NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It was about an Egyptian Priest named Arius who had been condemned in 2 separate Synods for teaching that Christ was Both NOT Divine, but rather a created being (Arianism).
@PolyPanTransMan @zanografix @DMMeeble @alan_bramley @womensmarch The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible (or leaving them out). That is a common misconception.

@PolyPanTransMan @zanografix @DMMeeble @alan_bramley @womensmarch The Nicene Creed wasn't "rules for being a Christian". It was an Creed rejecting Arianism and affirming the Deity of Christ.

Nicaea dealt with Arianism and a few other "housekeeping" issues such as settling a dispute over the date of Easter and rules for governing bishops.

@QuantasticGuy @BoboBreaker @ozkankobak @IwanKaban @cz_binance The Doctrine of the Trinity LONG predates the Council of Nicaea.

The Divinity of Christ was preached from the very beginning of the Christian faith.
@RC_Thornhill @wichman_matthew @SimianWojak @Nikolas0fNorway @_corycasual @JonnyYounboi The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be left out.

That is a common misconception.
The issue of the Canon of the Bible was NOT discussed, much less decided at Nicaea.
@RCaseyAMcDaniel @SanctusAndreas_ @MargoCatholic @BWCACatholic The Council of Nicaea didn't even do THAT much regarding the Canon of the Bible.

There's no indication they said anything about it AT ALL.
@REALaltee The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with writing or compiling the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@RMcgillss @passivblock @djrothkopf The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.
The 4 Gospels, along with 90% of the NT had been universally accepted as Scripture since the 2nd Century.

@RadicalChrisism @SikadwaKofi @gigamarx @crystalh548 @ronrico404 @HasadSicarii I have read the writings of people who were actually THERE at Nicaea. And I have read all of the Canons of the Council (a record of all of the decisions made by the Council).
There is NO MENTION of any discussion, vote, or decision about adding or removing any book from the Bible
@RadicalChrisism @SikadwaKofi @gigamarx @crystalh548 @ronrico404 @HasadSicarii No books were "removed" from the Bible at Nicaea. No books were ADDED to the Bible at Nicaea.

The issue of what books should be in the Bible NEVER EVEN CAME UP at the Council of Nicaea.

They were focused in the Arian Controversy, and dealing with a few other minor disputes.

@RadicalChrisism @SikadwaKofi @gigamarx @crystalh548 @ronrico404 @HasadSicarii Yep. I came up with that title because modern American have forgotten their History.

That's why they end up believing half-baked Conspiracy Theories about the Council of Nicaea picking the books of the Bible. Because they haven't been taught ACTUAL history.

It's important.
@RandalRauser The doctrine of the Trinity long predates Nicaea. The Scriptures themselves, and the Early Church affirmed all of the essential elements of the Doctrine that was codified at Nicaea.

What developed wasn't the belief in the Trinity, but the precise Theological terminology we use.
@RaphaelHarris9 @TomBlenkinsop @EU_NO_MORE The Council of Nicaea had nothing to do with the name "Mary".

Sheesh! Folks just blame anything they don't like or understand in Christianity on the Council of Nicaea! 🙄

"Mary" is just the English version of the Hebrew name "Miriam". That's all.
@Rational1414 @Bureaucracybust @PadreTeofiloR There were NO WHITE PEOPLE at the Council of Nicaea.

Nicaea made NO mention of Jesus' skin color at all.

Everyone at Nicaea were people of color. Africans, Copts, Syrians, Greeks, Arabs, Italians, etc. But NO WHITE PEOPLE.

The lead Bishop was a Black African named Athanasius.
@RebelATliance @Orvold42 @r_graus @InfiDale3476 Good article, actually.

It confirms what I said. The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It was a much longer process that took nearly 500 years and was a more organic process of the general consensus of ALL the churches.
@RebelATliance @Orvold42 @r_graus @InfiDale3476 If that were true, the Council of Nicaea would have voted in favor of the ARIANS, since they were the side favored by Constantine in the head up to Nicaea.

His Sister, Flavia &amp; his key advisor, Eusebius of Nicomedia, were allies of Arius. Eusebius is the one who got the Emperor
@RebelATliance @Orvold42 @r_graus @InfiDale3476 There were several local Synods and Councils that had only LOCAL or Regional jurisdiction that officially recognized the canons already in common use in their churches.  No single Ecumenical Council determined the Canon of the Bible.

Nicaea never even broached the subject.
@RebelATliance @Orvold42 @r_graus @InfiDale3476 You don't have to believe that Christianity is true to acknowledge basic Historical facts. 

Here are the records of the decisions made at the Council of Nicaea:

No mention anywhere of them choosing the books of the Bible.

That is an 18th Century MYTH.
@RebelATliance @Orvold42 @r_graus @InfiDale3476 to intervene in the Arian Controversy in the first place.
Constantine initially thought the issue was a trivial matter &amp; told them to resolve it themselves.

But when the Controversy grew, he called the Council of Nicaea to resolve it.

@SONOFJFK @RachelBitecofer 5. They didn't impose pagan ideas &amp; practices on Christianity. They didn't impose Sunday worship, Easter, or Christmas. All of these had been practiced &amp; celebrated by Christians for CENTURIES before Nicaea, and NONE of them are of Pagan origins.
@SONOFJFK @RachelBitecofer 6. Constantine DIDN'T impose his will on the Council. In fact, he actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. But the Council voted to CONDEMN Arianism. They voted AGAINST his preferred group.
@SONOFJFK @RachelBitecofer But there is also a lot of misinformation out there about the Council of Nicaea.
1. They didn't choose the books of the Bible. Never even discussed the matter.
2. They didn't invent the Trinity or make Jesus God. Belief in the Trinity &amp; the Deity of Christ LONG preceded Nicaea.

No hint anywhere of such a "Trinity" as "Father, Mother, Son". Belief in the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit LONG preceded Nicaea.

Nicaea did NOT "remove" or "change" any basic tenet of Christianity.

Nicaea didn't INVENT the Trinity. Nicaea DEFENDED &amp; CLARIFIED the Trinity.
@Samirben1996 @TheSoleWitness @atheistsposting No one at Nicaea was a pagan. They were Christians.

@SilenceDOGood47 3. You are, of course, entitled to your own opinions. However, the Council of Nicaea didn't introduce any NEW belief into Christianity. They expressed &amp; defended the SAME faith that was shared by the Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, back to the beginning.
@SilenceDOGood47 Correct.

Gnosticism didn't require a Church Council to address it.

Arianism did. That's what the Council of Nicaea was all about.
@SilenceDOGood47 Gnosticism wasn't even an issue at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about ARIANISM, not Gnosticism.
@SilenceDOGood47 Lol, no!
Not beheaded!
That's stuff that didn't happen until way into the Middle Ages.

Remember, in this earlier period, the Church had no power (and no inclination) to use force against heretics.

Even after Nicaea, NO ONE was executed.
@SilenceDOGood47 Most of this isn't even Theology. It's just HISTORY.

There's a lot of false narratives &amp; Conspiracy Theories built around the Council of Nicaea.

People assume there was shenanigans &amp; powerful people forcing their beliefs on Christianity.

But the reality was quite the opposite.
@SilenceDOGood47 The Council of Nicaea didn't establish the Church (that was back in 33 AD), but they did recognize the prominence of 5 key Bishops, Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. These 5 "Patriarchs" would be most prominent among the bishops who were otherwise equals.
@SilenceDOGood47 Yes.
But even after Nicaea, the pope wasn't the "head of the Church" as they are of the Catholic Church now. Nicaea recognized 5 "Patriarchs" of the Church: Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.
Only in the 5th Century, did pope Leo I begin to claim Supremacy.
@SilenceDOGood47 Yes. If you want to know about those teachings, you should read the writings of the Early Church Fathers. They are available online for free. You will be surprised how similar they are to POST Nicene Christianity they are.
Here are some good ones to start:

@SledgeCriss The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with taking things out of the Bible, or with choosing which books to include in or exclude from the Bible.

Also, Reincarnation is a Far Eastern concept and was NEVER part of Christian beliefs. It wasn't "removed" from the Bible.
@SledgeCriss The fact is that the issue of the content of the Bible never even came up for DISCUSSION at the Council of Nicaea, much less was decided upon.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@SledgeCriss The idea that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code and spread all over the internet via memes and Social Media.

It is not actually historically true.
@SledgeCriss Yes. I am sure.

I have studied this subject for nearly 30 yrs. I have an advanced degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

I have read the original source materials from Nicaea, the actual official records of the decisions made by the Council, as well as
@SledgeCriss the writings of the men who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

There is ZERO evidence that the Council ever even DISCUSSED the matter of the Biblical Canon, much less decided on it.
@Smile_Cryptid @BumpstockBarbie @dawaa33037779 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with voting on the Canon of the Bible.

That is an 18th Century myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code and spread on the internet via Memes and Tweets like yours.
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@Sophilautia Much later on, yes. Like, in the Middle Ages, a form of Gnosticism resurfaced &amp; was suppressed.

But not in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries when it was at its height. You have to remember that in those days, Christianity was an illicit, illegal Religion.

But it wasn't an issue at Nicaea
@SpaceDogzzzz @Ninjatrader110 @VegasVisions Seriously, the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with choosing which books would be included in the Bible.

The matter never even came up at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy.
@SpitSocial @javierfraser1 @Johnsonverse @Michell15182771 @onlynemy @smoothb92086457 Here is the final version of the Nicene Creed (Nicene-Constantinople Creed of 381 AD) that is recited in churches all over the world even today.

https://t.co/CJTedg4PHy
@SpitSocial @javierfraser1 @Johnsonverse @Michell15182771 @onlynemy @smoothb92086457 Much of the Canon had already been determined since the 2nd Century.

4 Gospels &amp; Acts
13 Pauline Epistles
James
1 Peter
1 John

Other books continued to be debated though the 5th Century.

But the above books were ALREADY accepted as Scripture long before Nicaea.
@SpitSocial @javierfraser1 @Johnsonverse @Michell15182771 @onlynemy @smoothb92086457 Nicaea affirmed Christ's true Divinity, acknowledging that he is "of one Substance (homoousios) with the Father", equal by Nature with the Father as touching his Divinity.

They condemned the teaching of Arius that "there was a time when the Son did not exist".
@SpitSocial @javierfraser1 @Johnsonverse @Michell15182771 @onlynemy @smoothb92086457 The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T "remove references to Mary Magdalene", not did they have ANYTHING to do with deciding which books would be included in the Bible.

No, we actually DO know what happened at Nicaea. We have the records of the decisions they made &amp; the writings of the men who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

We also know, because of extensive records, how the Bible was ACTUALLY canonized.
https://t.co/RC6yrNUHQr
@Stevementzer8 @Icantkeepquiet2 @kramehr Also, side note, the pope didn't even ATTEND the Council of Nicaea. He sent two Legates in his place.

This was more of an Eastern controversy than a Roman one. Nearly all of the delegates at Nicaea were from the East.

The Arian Controversy started in Alexandria, Egypt.
@Stevementzer8 @Icantkeepquiet2 @kramehr And here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

@Stevementzer8 @Icantkeepquiet2 @kramehr No sir. They in fact DID NOT choose what was to be included in the Roman Catholic Bible.

But when the Council turned against Arius from the very first session, Constantine backed the
@TheRealLogosT @xingtemplars @4everContrarian @BrandanJR Constantine and his sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, after him continued to persecute Nicene Christianity, deposing Nicene bishops &amp; replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire.

It took another Church Council in 381 AD at Constantinople to finally defeat Arianism.
@TheRealLogosT @xingtemplars @4everContrarian @BrandanJR Eventually.

But in the years after Nicaea, Arianism actually GREW in power.
St Jerome to famously lamented, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

It took another 56 yrs &amp; another Church Council in 381AD at Constantinople to finally defeat Arianism.
@TheRealLogosT @xingtemplars @4everContrarian @BrandanJR He exiled the bishops who refused to sign the Nicene Creed.

But then he changed his mind a short 2 yrs later and rescinded their exile and brought them back. He made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor and began persecuting Nicene bishops
@TheRealLogosT @xingtemplars @4everContrarian @BrandanJR It condemned the Arian heresy, but unfortunately it did NOT destroy Arianism.

In fact, because Constantine ended up reneging on his support for the Niceans shortly after Nicaea, backing the Arians &amp; persecuting Niceans, Arianism actually GREW in power over the following decades.
@TheSkeptic4122 Jesus was NOT invented at the Council of Nicaea.

But they did NOT canonize the Bible.
@Theprophetcome1 @Askwhyisit Ironically, Constantine didn't have quite the "watchful eye" you might think. He actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.
He felt that Arianism was easier to explain &amp; easier for former pagans to accept.

Yet the Council voted AGAINST his wishes.
@Theprophetcome1 @Askwhyisit It is my understanding that what St Jerome is referring to is the fact that someone at Nicaea QUOTED from Judith and called it "Scripture", indicating that by that time Judith had been recognized as Scripture.

There's no indication that he necessarily meant they VOTED on it.
@Thessalon1ka @FredoMcJudas @GeraldRoyperson And then, at Eusebius' urging, Constantine began persecuting Nicene bishops, deposing them &amp; replacing them with Arian bishops.

After his death, his sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, continued this policy.

In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea.
@Thessalon1ka @FredoMcJudas @GeraldRoyperson Far from shaping the outcome and the beliefs at Nicaea, the Council demonstrated it's independence from the Emperor by going completely AGAINST his wishes.

But, ever the savvy politician, Constantine backed the winning side in the end....well...at least at first.
@Thessalon1ka @FredoMcJudas @GeraldRoyperson Quite the opposite was true.

Constantine, influenced by his sister, Flavia, and his advisor, Eusebius of Nicomedia, ally of Arius, actually supported the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.

Constantine felt that Arianism was easier to explain &amp; easier for former pagans to accept.
@Thessalon1ka @GeraldRoyperson @FredoMcJudas Modalism was rejected by the Christian community in the 3rd Century.

Modalism originated in the late 2nd Century, but died out by the end of the 3rd Century without needing a Church Council to condemn it.

Modalism was not an issue at Nicaea.
@ThomasCoutouzis What do you think Nicaea had to do with it?
@ThomasSujit Especially since the Canon of Scripture wasn't truly finalized until over 100 AFTER Nicaea.
@Tiffany4444444 @bodhishari @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 I'm saying you have some misconceptions about what happened at Nicaea that you need to correct.

It is a MYTH that Nicaea chose the books of the Bible. It was started in the 18th century by the philosopher Voltaire, then popularized by The DaVinci Code.

It's not actually true.
@Tiffany4444444 @bodhishari @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 It's the kind of myth that gets spread on the internet via memes and Social Media. People grab onto it and never fact check it, just believe it. 

But it has no basis in actual historical facts.

Nicaea was about ARIANISM, not the Biblical Canon.
@Tiffany4444444 @bodhishari @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 Nope. The Council of Nicaea DIDN'T determine what to include in the Bible.

In fact, they never even DISCUSSED what to include in the Bible. The matter never even came up at Nicaea.

And no....there is NO evidence whatsoever that reincarnation was EVER a part of Christian belief.
@Tiffany4444444 @bodhishari @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 Nothing was removed from the Bible at the Council of Nicaea.

And no, Reincarnation was NEVER a Christian teaching. And Nicaea didn't "remove" reincarnation from the Bible either.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not editing the Biblical Canon.
@Tiffany4444444 @bodhishari @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 So it's just your opinion. Fine. 

Please update your information about the Council of Nicaea, though.

That part is simply factually, historically incorrect. 

Nicaea DIDN'T determine the Biblical Canon.

They never even discussed the matter.
@Tiffany4444444 @bodhishari @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 The Council of Nicaea was about resolving the Arian Controversy. That was the central focus of the Council.

There were other minor issues dealt with, like resolving a dispute over how to calculate the date for Easter, &amp; rules governing bishops. 

But not the Biblical Canon.

@Truth_is_Truth2 @ifffster It wasn't until the Council of Constantinople 56 yrs after Nicaea, that Arianism was finally defeated in the Church.

Arianism first cropped up in the late 3rd, early 4th Century.

The Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Centuries all taught the full Deity of Christ.

Did you realize that Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea, and only backed the Trinitarians when it became clear that the Council had turned against Arius from the very first session?

Did you know that he RENEGED on that support shortly AFTER
@Truth_is_Truth2 @ifffster What Scholars WILL say is that the precise terminology and theological language that we use now to describe the Trinity developed over time through controversies and responding to Heresies.

The Council of Nicaea was called, not to create the Trinity, but to CONDEMN ARIANISM.

Nicaea literally had NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible. Nothing. The matter never even came up at all at Nicaea.

Its an 18th Century Myth started by Voltaire.
@UB0NGA The first 500 yrs of Christianity, it was almost exclusively found among people of color. It didn't reach Germany until the 4th Century and England in the 6th Century.
At the Council of Nicaea, the lead Bishop was a black African from Egypt named Athanasius of Alexandria.
@UB0NGA Those present at Nicaea were ALL People of color. Africans, Copts, Syrians, Arabs, Greeks &amp; Italians.

The Apostles themselves first brought Christianity to Africa (St. Mark) &amp; as far East as India &amp; Persia (St. Thomas). Some of the oldest churches in Christianity are in Africa.

And no, they didn't even DISCUSS which books to include in the Bible.

The Council of Nicaea was EXPLICITLY about the Arian Controversy.

The Biblical Canon was NOT an issue the Council of Nicaea dealt with at all.
@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman Constantinople was necessary because the Emperor Constantine reneged on his support for Nicene Christianity.

@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman Emperor Constantine. Eusebius asked Constantine to intervene because Arius had a growing following. Constantine initially thought the matter was a trivial issue and told them to resolve it themselves. But the Controversy grew.

Finally, he called the Council of Nicaea.
@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman Explicitly doesn't mean "exclusively".

It means specifically and unequivocally.

The EXPLICIT reason the Council of Nicaea was called was the Arian controversy.

The 20 Canons didn't create the hierarchy. It only smoothed over &amp; standardized some issues of church discipline.
@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman Homoiousios means that the Son was "of SIMILAR Essence" with the Father.

But the Council decided on a term the Arians could absolutely NOT accept,  "homoousios", or "of the SAME Essence" with the Father.

And the original form of the Nicene Creed was adopted.
@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman I mean, for crying out loud, you started this while debate claiming the Council of Nicaea was about the Dead Sea Scrolls! 🙄

Now suddenly your an expert on this?

You clearly have NO idea what you are talking about and are just now reading a WIKIPEDIA article on the matter.
@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman Neither of those Councils decided or even discussed which books to include in the Bible.

You need to stop getting your information about History and Religion from memes.

None of that is true.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
They DIDN'T assemble the Bible.
@Umm_w0t @kurama86 @WeAreAllTruman Other than a few housekeeping issues, like developing uniform rules for bishops and resolving a dispute over the formula for calculating the date for Easter, the Arian Controversy was the CENTRAL issue at Nicaea. 

I don't know how you could possibly deny that.

@Wandera92816771 Gnosticism developed in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Century. The Gnostic Gospels were all written during this time.

The Earliest Christians WERE NOT Gnostics.

And the Council of Nicaea was about ARIANISM, not Gnosticism.
Gnosticism wasn't even an issue at Nicaea.
@Wandera92816771 No, Nicaea made NO decisions about either the Canon OR Gnosticism.

Neither of those were issues the Council of Nicaea even dealt with.

Here's the original documents from Nicaea itself, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
 
Read it.
@Wandera92816771 Please provide even ONE Historical source that says this.

Just one.

You can't because there is NO evidence to support it.

You are spewing something you saw in a MEME! There's not one single credible source out there that says what you are saying.

Nicaea was about ARIANISM!
@Wandera92816771 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining the Canon of the Bible.

And those books you listed were NEVER part of the Bible to begin with, so they couldn't be "removed".

The Gnostic Gospels were never at any time part of the Bible.
@WarrenRowley @koamac @NikkiNikkinow2 The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@WasabiWasup @El_Saviento @DNy1818 @ByzCat @VoiceOfSalusa Oh, and also, the Doctrine of the Trinity LONG predated the Council of Nicaea. 

The Trinity wasn't "invented" at Nicaea, it was DEFENDED and CLARIFIED at Nicaea.

Stop getting your knowledge of history from memes.
@WasabiWasup @El_Saviento @DNy1818 @ByzCat @VoiceOfSalusa The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which Books would be included in the Bible.

That is an 18th Century myth started by Voltaire and popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio He absolutely rejects your claim. 

There's NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE that the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

You have nothing. Zero, zip, nada.
Not a scrap of evidence.
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio He isn't "buying the Vatican line".
He's an avowed ATHEIST.

He follows the evidence.

And he absolutely rejects the idea that Nicaea chose the books of the Bible, because IT SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE!
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio Here is the info on what actually happened at the Council of Nicaea.

@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio Here's the famed Historian and Biblical Scholar Bart Ehrman, who happens to be an ATHEIST, and who also debunks the false Conspiracy Theory that Constantine &amp; the Council of Nicaea chose the books if the Bible:

@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio In case you want further evidence, here are the ACTUAL Canons of Nicaea, the records of the official decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

Read them for yourself. No mention of choosing the books of the Bible.

Because they didn't.
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Bible OR Freemasonry.

They never even discussed the issue of the Canon of the Bible, much less decided it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio The existence of other texts is recognized by everyone.
No one disputed that there are hundreds of other texts. 

But the idea that the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible is simply unsupported by any evidence whatsoever.
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio There are many books that never made it into the Bible, yes.
The Gnostic Gospels were never even considered for inclusion in the Bible.

But the idea that the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible is simply FICTION.

It simply did not happen.
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio There's plenty of ancient texts. 

But none if them show that the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

None of them. Not one.

Yes, lots of alternative "Gospels" l. No evidence that Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with it.

None.
@WeareTheCypher @SlumberMachine @TheTurkeyNFT @globalfreedomms @Bobettio They literally did not.

@WeinsteinDr @MPaperni @DumisaniTemsgen The Christian Bible was NOT put together at the Council of Nicaea.

That is a common misconception.
They never even discussed the matter much less decided on it.

@Wh1teL1ghtMag1c @faithhammer3 @ReneeFurr But again, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books would be included in the Bible.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@Wh1teL1ghtMag1c @faithhammer3 @ReneeFurr Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with "putting the Bible together". They neither added to nor "threw out" any books from the Bible at Nicaea.

That is a common misconception.

The subject of the content of the Bible never even came up at Nicaea.
@Wh1teL1ghtMag1c @faithhammer3 @ReneeFurr Nope. They didn't.

Didn't happen.

Not at the Council of Nicaea.
There's no record anywhere of them even DISCUSSING which books to include in the Bible, much less deciding on it. 

Dead Sea Scrolls had nothing to do with Nicaea either.

@Whyamid52497607 @Paultx890 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "leaving whole books out" of the Bible.

They didn't deal with the content of the Bible AT ALL at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@WildShamhat @abuchi_handle @xavierjp__ You are confusing the Council of Nicaea with Gnosticism, which they absolutely DID NOT espouse.

The term "Demiurge" and "Second God" were NEVER uttered at Nicaea.

The term "Homoousios", however, WAS used.

Stop making things up about Nicaea.

@Wiseskay7 @YeshuaSavess @fahs35540196 @UTDprotuz @HassanRai32 @muslimdaily_ Nope.

@Yorks_atheist The Doctrine of the Trinity LONG predates the Council of Nicaea.

The very fact that the Council had to he called to address the Arian controversy indicates that belief in the Trinity predated Nicaea.

Even the term "Trinity" was coined to describe the belief over 150 yrs before.
@ZacPac The Council of Nicaea was called because of the teachings of an Egyptian Presbyter named Arius, who was condemned in 2 local Synods for teaching that Christ was NOT Divine, but rather a created, but exalted being, the first and greatest creation of God.
@ZacPac They DIDN'T:
1. "Invent" the Trinity. Belief in the Trinity LONG predated Nicaea.
2. Impose pagan beliefs &amp; practices on the Church.
3. Change the Day of Worship from the Sabbath to Sunday. They had been worshiping on Sunday since the 1st Century.
4. Choose the books of the Bible

@ZacPac to meet together to decide the issue. 318 bishops met together in Nicaea in May, 325 AD.
Interestingly, Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. He felt that Arianism was easier to explain and easier for former pagans to accept.
@ZayaZig @Jesusarmy Nicaea met in 325 AD, not 313 AD. 
And the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include in the Bible. The matter never even came up. They did NOT "doctor" the Bible.

It never happened. Nicaea had nothing to do with it
@_Josepher_ @iluminatibot And the Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in or exclude from the Bible.

They never even discussed it, much less decided on it.

That's an 18th Century Myth started by Voltaire &amp; popularized by The DaVinci Code.
@_Josepher_ @iluminatibot There were no Jews in attendance at Nicaea.

There were no pagans in attendance at Nicaea.

They were Christian bishops. Not one of them was a Jew or a pagan.
@_KarlRogers The Essenes were a small Apocalyptic JEWISH (not Christian) sect. 

Their writings and their teachings were NEVER AT ANY TIME part of the Christian Bible or Christian beliefs.

They were not only not "removed" at Nicaea, they were never even an issue AT ALL EVER.
@_Krimsen_King @Defetyone Again, neither the Council of Nicaea nor the Emperor Constantine had ANYTHING whatsoever to do with removing or adding books to the Bible.

That is just a false Conspiracy Theory. It isn't supported by the actual documentation or ANY evidence whatsoever.

It just didn't happen.
@_Krimsen_King @Defetyone Here's the Canons of the Council of Nicaea. There's 20 of them. And the original text of Nicene Creed of 325AD (it would later be amended to the Creed we use today at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD)
No mention of choosing the books of the Bible

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@_Krimsen_King @Defetyone No, it wasn't "close enough". It was dead wrong.

No one "tore entire books out of the Bible". Not at Nicaea, and not at ANY point in the process of canonizing the Bible.

Your point does NOT stand. The whole narrative you are presenting is contrary to the historical record.
@_Krimsen_King @Defetyone Sorry, that's just not historically accurate. The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include or exclude from the Bible.

@___Trace___ @tshow78 @Devine_Writer @MrAndyNgo @efdouglass @FoolNelson Belief in the Divinty of Christ LONG preceded Nicaea. It is not only taught in the Scriptures, but also by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries...long before Nicaea. https://t.co/1T6NOtTAuc
@___Trace___ @tshow78 @Devine_Writer @MrAndyNgo @efdouglass @FoolNelson The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "reworking" the Bible.
@___Trace___ @tshow78 @Devine_Writer @MrAndyNgo @efdouglass @FoolNelson The Council of Nicaea didn't INVENT belief in the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ. Rather they DEFENDED &amp; CLARIFIED what had always been believed.

They developed more precise Theological terminology to describe the belief that had already existed prior to Nicaea.
@_deenchaser The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That is an 18th Century Myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.
@_deenchaser The Gospel of Judas was written in the late 2nd Century, so it was clearly NOT written by Judas or anyone associated with him.

That, and it's unorthodox content was WHY it was never included in the Bible. (Though the Council of Nicaea had nothing to do with that).
@_derNomade Well, no, since Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That's a common misconception.
@abbynormal75 @whatep @BeatTheCult That's not what I am saying. I'm not trying to convince you that the Divinity of Christ is TRUE. That is a matter of faith.

I am demonstrating that the belief in the Divinty of Christ within Christianity was NOT invented at Nicaea. That is a matter of Historical record.
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix Ah, I have found the passage you are referring to.

It says, "But since the Nicene Council is considered to have counted this book among the number of sacred Scriptures, I have acquiesced to your request".

Since we have no evidence that the Council of Nicaea actually debated or
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix But that is a long way from saying they PICKED the books of the Bible.

Especially since the debates over the Canon of Scripture continued for over a Century AFTER Nicaea.
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix It's not found in the Canons of the Nicene Council that there was any vote or decisions regarding which books to include or exclude from the Bible.

But they had to have at least a generally shared understanding of what was Scripture in order to appeal to it in debates.
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix Oh, and the Council of Nicaea was NOT in 34 and 35 AD. It was in 325 AD.
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in the Bible.
The issue never even came up for discussion, much less a vote or a decision.
Nicaea had nothing whatsoever to do with what books were included or excluded from the Bible
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix The Nicene Creed was an affirmation of the teaching of the Christian faith from the beginning. But it was phrased in language that clarified what was meant and NOT meant so as to exclude certain FALSE ideas, specifically, Arianism.
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix The idea that Nicaea picked the books of the Bible is a conspiracy theory that dates to the 18th Century (Voltaire is credited with starting it), and popularized in the present day by the Dan Brown novel and movie, The DaVinci Code.

But the historical records show it's not true
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix We also have the writings of the people who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius of Alexandria, Arius, Eusebius of Caesarea, Eusebius of Nicomedia, and, of course even Constantine himself.

No mention anywhere of what books to include in the Bible.
@abimbsreal @michaelmathew91 @funshographix Well... I'm not quite THAT old! LOL!

But we actually have the Canons of the Council of Nicaea, the record if the official decisions made by the Council. There are 20 of them. Not one mentions anything about what books to be included in the Bible.

@amx7q @Chud_Din4 @PatricusMaximus @pngofwater @MalangKhostaay It is this practice that caused St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

In fact in the 56 yrs after Nicaea Arianism actually GREW in power and influence.

It took another Church Council in 381AD to finally defeat Arianism
@amx7q @Chud_Din4 @PatricusMaximus @pngofwater @MalangKhostaay Sorry, man, but that's not the truth.

Constantine actually supported the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea, and he only ended up backing the Trinitarians after it became clear that the Council had turned against Arius from the very first session.

He did exile those who refused to
@amx7q @Chud_Din4 @PatricusMaximus @pngofwater @MalangKhostaay sign the Nicene Creed. But a scant 2 yrs later, he rescinded the exile and brought them back. He even made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor.

Constantine RENEGED on his support for the Trinitarians after that and began to petsecute

@asdhillon86 @BRijswijk @WinsXavi @Katy27529 @rtwngsavages @Doc_Chimpanzee @elonmusk @AOC It didn't INVENT the concept of the Trinity, as belief in the Trinity preceded Nicaea by centuries.

It DEFENDED and CLARIFIED the Doctrine of the Trinity against the teachings of Arius of Alexandria.

And Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.
@asekin113 @JackPosobiec The Bible was NOT Canonized by Constantine OR by the Council of Nicaea.

@badmetaverse I also like the intrigue in the lead up to the Council, where Eusebius of Nicomedia tried to get his supporters to Nicaea and prevent others from getting there. 
Here's where my fiction comes in as I dramatize the dirty tricks each side used to stack the Council with their people
@badmetaverse I like Athanasius as the lead character because he began the whole thing as Alexander's pupil and secretary, and eventually became the leader of the Nicene bishops.

Also, he was a person of color. He was a black African of short stature, but powerful intellect and oratory.
@badmetaverse In actuality, the question of the Canon of the Bible never even came up at Nicaea.

But that myth is widely believed, largely because it was popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; now it spreads on the internet via memes and Social Media.

But it isn't actually true.
@badmetaverse Question: given the perspective you are writing from, are you including the Myth that the Council of Nicaea voted on and determined which books would be in the Bible?

You know that didn't actually happen, right? That's an 18th Century myth started by the philosopher Voltaire.
@badmetaverse So sorry. That sucks.

I'd seriously read your book, btw.
I love the subject matter.

I'm actually working on an Historical Fiction novel myself dramatizing the Council of Nicaea, and the events leading up to it. It's tentatively called "The Council".

Only have a few chapters.
@badmetaverse That's cool. I'd be totally into that. Great concept for a story!

I wrote from the perspective of Athanasius, the young secretary and Deacon to the aged Patriarch Alexander of Alexandria, who would become Alexander's spokes person at Nicaea and eventually succeed him as bishop.
@barth_bro If your bishop didn't slap a heretic at Nicaea, you cannot celebrate Christmas.
@bathoryduck @TheSkeptic4122 The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T determine which books to include in the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
In fact, the subject of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

@be_happyto @endtimeslife I am.

Let's start with the fact that the Council of Nicaea DIDN'T "invent" the Trinity, because the Doctrine of the Trinity LONG predated Nicaea.

The term "Trinity" itself was coined 150 yrs before Nicaea to describe the belief in God as F, S &amp; HS, which was believed from the
@be_happyto @endtimeslife I do.

And that's why I know that the Trinity wasn't "made up" by the Council of Nicaea. Belief in the Trinity LONG predated Nicaea, back to the 1st Century, and the very beginning of the Christian faith.
@be_happyto @endtimeslife very beginning of the Christian faith. 
Belief in the Deity of Christ is taught in the New Testament, as well as being believed by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries LONG before Nicaea.

You wanna talk Church History?
I'm game.
@benedictsred (No one at all was killed by the Council of Nicaea)
@benedictsred No one was killed by the Council of Nicaea.
@berryblackwater @BamaSox @noah_nonsense @DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @realchrisrufo Please read the link you yourself posted. It doesn't say ANYTHING LIKE that.

Read it yourself.

The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the Canon of the Bible.

That's a common misconception.
It is simply NOT true.
@bestqueenliz The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "removing all texts that spoke of empowered women".

Contrary to popular myth, the Council of Nicaea DID NOT determine the Canon of the Bible. They neither added nor removed ANY books of the Bible.

That is a myth.
@bestqueenliz The Council of Nicaea was actually about the Arian Controversy, not the Canon of the Bible.

Here's the actual history of how the Bible was canonized.
@bestqueenliz The idea that the Council of Nicaea chose the books if the Bible is an 18th Century myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, and popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, then spread on the internet via memes and Social Media.

https://t.co/DseHAMsT9m
@bevo2323 You understand that the Council of Nicaea literally had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books would be included in the Bible, right?

That's a modern Conspiracy Theory popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

It never happened.
They never even DISCUSSED it.
@bigleebadmfer @AlThomp @BGaloot44 @missmonz @JoJoFromJerz Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea actually had ANYTHING to do with writing or choosing the books if the Bible.

If you actually DID any research, you'd find that this is an 18th Century Myth popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.
@bilalthearab @AndrewJRParker @anselm_turmeda Jesus was preached as God LONG before Nicaea. The New Testament as well as the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries all taught the Deity of Christ hundreds of years before Nicaea. https://t.co/QMbqBoX43L
@bilalthearab @matthewbarjonah @anselm_turmeda Neither the Trinity nor the Divinity of Christ are of Pagan origins.

And the doctrines were NOT invented at Nicaea.

They both LONG predated Nicaea back to the 1st Century. https://t.co/R9QEHCmPYS
@bilalthearab @matthewbarjonah @anselm_turmeda That didn't happen. No one threw away or removed ANY books from the Bible.

And the process of deciding the Canon WASN'T done at Nicaea or by ANY single Council, group, or person. It was a long process of the general consensus of ALL the churches over a span of about 500 yrs.
@bilalthearab @matthewbarjonah @anselm_turmeda The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with altering the Bible.

They never even discussed the Canon of the Bible at Nicaea.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@bilalthearab @matthewbarjonah @anselm_turmeda The belief in the Deity of Christ LONG predates Nicaea.

The New Testament itself &amp; the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries taught that Jesus is God Incarnate. https://t.co/nKBWkGTvTK
@blu57nav @SuperTRev166 @Renevelation Constantine's 50 Bibles were compiled AFTER Nicaea. It wasn't decided by the Council.

He commissioned Eusebius of Caesarea to have the Bibles made. But Constantine gave NO input or instructions as to what books to include in these Bibles.

Eusebius' canon was different from ours
@blu57nav @SuperTRev166 @Renevelation That is a matter of belief.

But I just wanted to dispel some common false narratives that often get thrown around by skeptics that simply aren't true.
It was NOT decided by a powerful Emperor &amp; a handful of elite white men (no one at Nicaea was white, btw) for Political purposes
@blu57nav @SuperTRev166 @Renevelation The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what went into the Bible.

That is a common misconception. It is an 18th Century myth started by Voltaire &amp; popularized by the novel The DaVinci Code.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@boa2112 @hemantmehta The Council of Nicaea actually had nothing whatsoever to do with "assembling the Bible" or choosing what books would be in it.

@bobhollyjr @sunshinee_2019 @MissIncogneato @OsloCreepee @iamAtheistGirl 5. Constantine didn't even get his way at Nicaea. He had favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. But the Council turned against Arius from the very first session. He tried to get compromise wording into the Creed that the Arians could accept, but the Council chose wording
@bobhollyjr @sunshinee_2019 @MissIncogneato @OsloCreepee @iamAtheistGirl Hoo boy. So much wrong with this, it's hard to know where to start.

1. The Christian Church existed for 300 years BEFORE Nicaea.
2. It was CONSTANTINE, not Theodosius, who called the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.
3. Theodosius I called the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD.
@bobhollyjr @sunshinee_2019 @MissIncogneato @OsloCreepee @iamAtheistGirl that they could NOT accept (homoousios). Ever the savvy politician, Constantine backed the winning side.

But he reneged on that support shortly after Nicaea. He rescinded the exile of the Arians &amp; made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor.
@bodhishari @Tiffany4444444 @DavidDRitter @MadAndy44 I am a Christian with an advanced degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

I go back to the original source materials, the actual ancient documents from Nicaea.

I trace the history of the Bible from actual ancient documents.
@bookofkatherine The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 367 AD.

Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with adding, or omitting ANY books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not determining the books of the Bible.
@brandon_d_smith Wait till some of the folks in there get the shocking news that the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T choose the books of the Bible! https://t.co/OBYMghAajO
@breestus @laelwix @TheMashFactor @MahiArchipelago The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@brendalicia79 @orthodoxanglicn They meant to write "ante-nicene", rather than "anti-nicene".

Anti means "against".
Ante means "before".

Two different prefixes. Anti vs Ante.
@brendoncandella @hilaryj37102836 @boboosta @joncoopertweets The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It wasn't any single person, group, or Council. It wasn't an event but a long process that began in the 1st Century and continued well into the 5th Century.

Nicaea wasn't involved, however.
@budNicaea @BeatTheCult Curious, what did you learn about the Council of Nicaea that made you not believe in God?
@budNicaea @BeatTheCult The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what was and wasn't Canon.

That's an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread on the internet via memes &amp; Social Media.

It is not true.
@budNicaea @BeatTheCult The fact is that the issue of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea. They never discussed it, much less decided on it.

@c0untswagula1 @KingOfSalt4 None of that is true.

The Trinity LONG preceded Nicaea. Even the term "Trinity" was coined 150 yrs BEFORE Nicaea.

@captainjack1988 @noah_nonsense @NwekeGospel @latestinspace There's dozens more, but perhaps you should just start with these.

@capucinefac (they didn't form the Bible at Nicaea... that's a common misconception)
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa Again, no. 

Jesus Christ was preached for 300 yrs before Nicaea. 

We have the New Testament written 50-95 AD. (AD never at any time meant "After Death")

And we have the writings of the Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Century. https://t.co/Bjlx3XH7vk
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa But Constantine reneged on that support shortly after Nicaea.

He rescinded the exile of the Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed, bringing them back and made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor.
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa Constantine actually favored the Arians in the head up to Nicaea.

He only backed the Niceans once it became clear that the Council had turned against Arius from the very first session.

He tried to get compromise language into the Creed that the Arians could accept (homoiousios)
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa Italians, etc. Christianity was born and grew up among people of color.
It is NOT a "White Religion".

THERE WERE NO WHITE PEOPLE AT NICAEA. The lead Bishop at Nicaea was a Black African, Athanasius of Alexandria.
No Anglo-Saxons, no Germanic, no Slavs, no Franks, Celts, or Welsh
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa The point of this is that Constantine DIDN'T get what he wanted at Nicaea. The Council actually voted AGAINST his wishes.

He was NOT trying to force the Nicene Creed on Christianity. He actually favored Arianism.
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa Then, at Eusebius' urging he began to persecute the Niceans, deposing Nicene bishops &amp; replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire.

Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea. It took another 56 yrs &amp; another Church Council in 381 AD to finally defeat Arianism.
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa You are talking about events that happened MANY centuries after Nicaea.

Don't conflate the two time periods.
Christianity didn't reach England until the 6th Century. It was in the Middle East, and North Africa LONG before that.
@casicruise @HafizSalisu6 @AMCEY24 @bbchausa You know that Athanasius was a black African from Alexandria, Egypt, right? And he was the leader of the orthodox Christians at Nicaea.

He was the Archbishop (Patriarch) of Alexandria, one of the most powerful bishops in the Christian Church at the time.
@cewollard @FormerGOP_Mom @whillikerz @RexChapman The myth about the Council of Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible was started in the 18th Century by the Philosopher Voltaire.
It was popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, and has spread on the internet in memes and Conspiracy Theory posts.
@cewollard @FormerGOP_Mom @whillikerz @RexChapman The narrative put forward by the Conspiracy Theories about Nicaea and the Bible are just wrong.

The Bible wasn't chosen by decree but by consensus. It wasn't chosen to secure power, it was chosen because it reflects genuine Apostolic teachings.
@ch_khodir @DarcPaladin @madkeys @Panosfrmgoranos @laurenboebert Please read the article you yourself posted.

It says NOTHING about the Council of Nicaea writing or choosing the books of the Bible.

The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in or exclude from the Bible.

That is a Myth.
@ch_khodir @DarcPaladin @madkeys @Panosfrmgoranos @laurenboebert The Council of Nicaea was about addressing the Arian Controversy, not about choosing the books of the Bible.

The issue of the Canon of the Bible didn't even come up for DISCUSSION at Nicaea, much less a vote.

That's NOT how the Bible was canonized.
@chapanzee @richsibling The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with selecting or writing the Scriptures.

They did NOT decide the Canon of the Bible, or even DISCUSS it at Nicaea.

That's an 18th century myth started by the philosopher Voltaire.
@chariot_iron @AnthonyManechia @Biased_Lemmings @DazzDzatron @muir2021 @LiveDie4Jesus Speaking of being misinformed...
1. The Gnostic Gospels denied Jesus' true HUMANITY, not his Deity.

3. Gnostic Gospels were written in the late 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries so they weren't Apostolic

The pope DIDN'T ATTEND the Council of Nicaea, he only sent Legates.

The Council of Nicaea DIDN'T decide which books would be in the Bible and which would be left out.

@chesternchloe4 @couchsportsman @PanseyWarrior @iluminatibot The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

And the KJV was NOT Catholic. It was translated many yrs after the Church of England broke from Rome.
@chrismdowd @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with "deciding what was even in the Bible".

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@chrismdowd @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner The vague mention by Jerome of the Book of Judith and the Council of Nicaea doesn't indicate that the Council voted on or chose the books of the Bible.

It doesn't indicate anything except that someone at Nicaea cited the book of Judith in discussions and called it "Scripture".
@chrismdowd @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner There is no indication in the actual records of Nicaea that any such debates or decisions regarding the Biblical Canon ever took place. 

And the fact that the Canon CONTINUED to be debated for over a CENTURY after Nicaea is further proof it didn't happen.
@chrismdowd @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner They DIDN'T "come up with the Trinity" at Nicaea. The Trinity had been believed and preached for CENTURIES before Nicaea.
Even the term "Trinity" was coined 150 yrs BEFORE Nicaea. How was a term coined in the 2nd Century for a doctrine that wouldn't exist until the 4th Century?🤔
@chrismdowd @noah_nonsense @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner But they didn't "invent" the Trinity Doctrine at Nicaea. It preceded Nicaea by centuries.

The Divinity of Christ and the Trinity had been taught from the beginning.

These beliefs were DEFENDED AND CLARIFIED at Nicaea, not invented.
@cjedgin @tgh1159 @SpockResists I wasn't making an argument...yet. I was asking for more information on what HE thinks that Constantine and the Council of Nicaea did.

Still would like to hear it.

Don't you think he has more information to share?
He seemed to imply he did.
@cjedgin @tgh1159 @SpockResists My reply with the meme wasn't to YOU, but to the guy who claimed there was something to be known about the Council of Nicaea and the Roman Emperor Constantine I that was relevant to your discussion about the Bible.

Still curious what HE thinks there is in all if that.
@colorado_trek @JackPosobiec Had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books to include in the Bible. Nor did they "remove" Enoch from the Bible.

@coonkirk777 Except it was.

In fact, the very term "Trinity" was coined 150 yrs BEFORE Nicaea.

So...how could a term be coined for a doctrine that wouldn't exist for another 150 yrs? 🤔

@dalepartridge Contrary to popular misconception, Constantine did NOT make Christianity the official Religion of the Roman Empire.

@dallinbunnell @Ocasio2024 @cyalaters @KatelynTweeter Which part of the Nicene Creed is "straight bull****"?

@dbreed714 @RonBorsh Yeah, unless he was not a very good Scholar, I kind of doubt that he actually said that Nicaea determined the Canon of the Bible.

It's just objectively, factually, historically FALSE, and any historian with ANY actual knowledge would have said that.
@debearscave The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T remove ANY books from the Bible, and in fact made NO decisions regarding the Biblical Canon at all.

@desire2sing @OperHealAmerica That's NOT what happened at Nicaea.

Christians had ALWAYS taught the Deity of Christ.

@eldominico5 @notcapnamerica The beliefs they voted on weren't INVENTED at Nicaea. Belief in the Divinity of Christ was preached from the beginning of the Christian faith.

It is proclaimed in Scripture and was preached by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries. https://t.co/e172osWkcc
@ellison_don @DarrowNelson @platoinCT @josh_a_scott The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books to include in the Bible.

@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 And this is not "newly discovered information". We have had this information for 1,700 yrs.

The idea that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible is an 18th century myth started by the philosopher Voltaire.

It is not, and never has been true.
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 Btw, the SECOND Council of Nicaea was in 787 AD and ALSO had nothing to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It was about whether it was okay to use Icons (specially painted wooden pictures of Jesus or various Saints) in Christian worship.
What was "mind blowing" about that?
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 Here is the well-researched, academically sound history of the Council of Nicaea from Encyclopedia Brittanica:
https://t.co/CJTedg4PHy
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 Ok.
Either way, you are factually incorrect.

The Council of Nicaea was about Arianism, not the Bible.

There is ZERO evidence that they determined what books would be in the Bible.

Here are the actual records of the Council of Nicaea:
https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 That's what I thought you were going to say.

@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 The issue of the make up if the Bible was NOT something the Council of Nicaea even discussed, much less decided on.

Nicaea was called to deal with the Arian Controversy.

It had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 What ABOUT the first and second Councils of Nicaea convinced you?

The 1st Council of Nicaea was about Arianism.

The 2nd Council of Nicaea was about the use of Icons in worship.

What about these Councils "blew your mind"?
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 What did you read?

I'm not giving you "views", I'm giving you ACTUAL history based on the ACTUAL records of Nicaea.

This isn't someone's opinion. This is what the Council of Nicaea ACTUALLY produced.
@emillyorr @nathaliejacoby1 You will note that in NONE of this is there ANY indication whatsoever that the Council of Nicaea had anything to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It is a MYTH. It Did. Not. Happen.

@feanoriel @caranthirs Arianism, not Aryanism.
Arianism is the Subordinationist doctrine of the Presbyter Arius which was condemned at the Council of Nicaea.

Aryanism is the Germanic pagan Mythology positing the German people as a "Master Race" descended from the Norse gods.

Two VERY different things

@firebrnd13 @RyanNDanker Constantine actually favored the Arians in the lead up to Nicaea.

He only backed the Niceans once it became clear the Council had turned solidly against Arius.

And then a few short yrs after Nicaea, he reneged on that support and once again backed the Arians.

So...no.

@gateman_heaven @SarahBasson4 @CriticalCupcake @grcastleberry What it counters is the false Narrative that the Bible is the product of one man, Constantine, who used Nicaea to reshape the Bible &amp; Christianity according to his own mix of pagan &amp; Christian beliefs to suit his own Political agenda.

Those bishops who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were deposed from their positions and exiled from the Empire.

But 2 yrs later, Constantine brought them back.

But he reneged on that support shortly after Nicaea &amp; backed the Arians again.
@homeopathy2010 @CrastoMervin @BrethrenIndia @abs_pc1 @Dharma_4_U @shudntbehere The fact is that the belief of the Church BEFORE Nicaea was that Christ was truly Divine as well as human. The Early Church Fathers explicitly taught the Divinity of Christ.

Arianism didn't develop until the late 3rd, early 4th Century.
@homeopathy2010 @CrastoMervin @BrethrenIndia @abs_pc1 @Dharma_4_U @shudntbehere Yes, the Council of Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
@howeverl0ng @heaveniscallin1 @akserayi @freemonotheist No one at Nicaea believed the Trinity included Mary. Not a single person.

NO ONE worshipped Mary as a God. 

That is just a misconception of the Trinity found in the Qur'an 600 yrs later.
@howwastomorrow @akjakalope @FredBar46096544 The Council of Nicaea didn't deal with Gnosticism AT ALL.

The primary focus of the Council of Nicaea was the Arian Controversy.
It didn't deal with Gnosticism, or choosing the books of the Bible, or any other myths about. Nicaea.

It was about correcting ARIANISM.
@hsunil10 @Gothicself @Sassy_Hindu Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 335. 
And Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with "writing the story of Jesus".

@imjustdalesia @thatsjay83 @ChastenedSaint @_JeanEon_ Well, you are probably right about that. There were a number of African bishops present, including St. Athanasius of Alexandria, who is explicitly described as being black.

@inengite_pius @JasonKhumaloII @biona_o @ope_yrn_ @Violettaonpoint Also, the lead Bishop at the Council of Nicaea was Athanasius of Alexandria, a black African, who helped to draft the Nicene Creed.

It proves that Constantine DIDN'T impose the practice on Christianity at Nicaea.
@iotservices7510 @ImCrescentFresh @StormGirl05 @servantofmessia @ronin19217435 That again is a theological opinion, not a statement of historical fact.

It is your OPINION that the Church went off track.

But your original claim that Constantine &amp; the Council of Nicaea introduced these ideas has been demonstrated to be FACTUALLY and historically FALSE.
@iotservices7510 @ImCrescentFresh @StormGirl05 @servantofmessia @ronin19217435 The Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD. That's the FOURTH Century, not the 3rd.

And no, they did NOT introduce Easter, Christmas &amp; Sunday Worship into Christianity. These practices date back CENTURIES before Nicaea and are NOT of Pagan origins.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@iotservices7510 @ImCrescentFresh @StormGirl05 @servantofmessia @ronin19217435 You have now moved the goalposts from those disproven claims that Nicaea changed Christian practices (they didn't) to a Theological debate over whether they SHOULD have done what you falsely claimed they didn't do until Nicaea.

You are all over the place.
@isaias131zx No, they didn't. Not even close.

@jaredmshearer @stewartdantec Actually, it was the other way around.

Constantine "went along with" the Council of Nicaea.
He had actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea, but when the Council turned against Arius at the very first session, ever the savvy politician, he backed the winning side.
@jaredmshearer @stewartdantec But his support for the Niceans was short lived. Even though he exiled Arius &amp; the handful of Arians for refusing to sign the Nicene Creed, he brought them BACK after only 2 yrs, and made Eusebius of Nicomedia, the lead Arian bishop, his personal Spiritual Advisor.
@jaredmshearer @stewartdantec Over the next several years, Constantine, at Eusebius' urging, began PERSECUTING Nicene bishops, deposing them and replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire. His sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, continued this policy after his death. It took another Church Council to

@jcdrewett @Doggod92436861 @GardenTreena @RonnyJacksonTX The Nicene Creed is a statement of faith, not a prayer.

There was no "culling" of other Gospels. The other Gospels were never even in consideration for inclusion in the Bible.

The one exception is the Gospel of Peter, which SOME considered Scripture but was ultimately excluded.

The Council of Nicaea never dealt with the issue of what books to include in the Bible.

They were focused on the Arian Controversy.
@jdaniel3636 @DLgodlessbitch The Council of Nicaea didn't debate over Revelation or any other book of the Bible.

The whole narrative that the Council of Nicaea determined the Canon of the Bible is an 18th Century Myth started by Voltaire &amp; popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

It's not true.
@jedmond_1818 @MIKECLINT1 @Notapreneur @Slyiskingg @ulxma @nwoke_anambra A common modern Conspiracy Theory regarding the Bible is that the Council of Nicaea in 325AD determined which books to include in the Bible.

The Council of Nicaea had exactly NOTHING to do with choosing what books would be in the Bible.
https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@jer_the_bear_42 @BeatTheCult The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with leaving the Gnostic Gospels out of the Bible. They never even discussed that at Nicaea.

The Gnostic Gospels were never at any time in consideration for inclusion in the Bible.
Here's why: https://t.co/KcZh4lbwhT
@jezlash @0bj3ctivity The Council of Nicaea had nothing to do with choosing the books of the Bible. 

They never even discussed the matter of the Biblical Canon at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@jfitzpatrick62 @VenomBilly1 Gnosticism wasn't even an issue at Nicaea!

Gnosticism had been repudiated in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Century.

The Council of Nicaea was NOT about Gnosticism. It was about the Arian Controversy primarily &amp; a few other minor "housekeeping" issues like the Date of Easter &amp; rules for Bishops
@jfitzpatrick62 @VenomBilly1 There were ZERO "Gnostic Christians" at Nicaea.
Gnosticism was rejected by the Church in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Century as being contrary to Apostolic teachings.

There was NO discussion of or decisions on the Canon of Scripture at Nicaea.
It was about the Arian Controversy, not the Bible
@jfitzpatrick62 @VenomBilly1 Yes, they did. And small pockets of Gnostics continued to exist in various places for several Centuries. But after the 3rd Century, it was not a major issue the Christian Church had to deal with.

It WASN'T an issue dealt with at the Council of Nicaea.
@jmpacific @MarlaFrees @wendy_resists The Gnostic Gospels were all written in the 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries. The NT writings were written between 50-95 AD.

And the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with "hand selecting the books included in the Bible".

https://t.co/CJTedg4PHy
@jocastarora @Lily_write @LittleMammith @gaforres @Urbanmonk73 @natedeenwriter The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with compiling or excluding the Books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea didn't deal with the Biblical Canon AT ALL. Never even came up.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not the Bible.
@joeldkershaw Right. Because of all the White people at Nicaea....
Wait...what? There WEREN'T ANY white people at Nicaea?
Seriously?
They were ALL people of color? Greeks, Africans, Copts, Arabs, Syrians &amp; Italians?

No Anglo-Saxons?

Then how did they invent "White Jesus"?
@jojipaindu @Crugcrypto @veggiefate @rahboychelsea @Mustafa1231231 @Gymshark The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "constructing" or compiling the Bible.

That's a common misconception.

@jojoemello @mosque57928055 @ScotReSisters @WackyPidgeon @MsGiveZeroFox @cache_pas @LezSpeakOut @RoseEMR85 @AmandaSamuels4 He doesn't say it was "added" at the Council. He said it was "recognized" at the Council. Which could mean nothing more than someone QUOTED it at the Council, referring to it as Scripture.

There's NO evidence whatsoever that the Biblical Canon was debated or voted on at Nicaea.
@jojoemello @mosque57928055 @ScotReSisters @WackyPidgeon @MsGiveZeroFox @cache_pas @LezSpeakOut @RoseEMR85 @AmandaSamuels4 NONE of the documents from Nicaea indicates any discussion, debate, or decisions regarding the Biblical Canon. That most certainly WOULD have been a big deal IF they had done it. There would be more than a single vague mention by Jerome a generation later regarding a single book.
@jojoemello @mosque57928055 @ScotReSisters @WackyPidgeon @MsGiveZeroFox @cache_pas @LezSpeakOut @RoseEMR85 @AmandaSamuels4 The Bible was NOT "compiled" by the Council of Nicaea.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

It wasn't even a subject that Nicaea dealt with.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama After his death, his sons, Constans and Constantius II, continued his policy of enforced Arianization.

In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea, prompting St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama And it appears that much of what you "know" about the history of the Bible is based on bad information.

If you think they decided on or compiled the Bible at Nicaea, you are simply mistaken.

It did not happen that way. And you have yet to show ANY evidence for your claims.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama Even though his preferred side LOST at Nicaea, Constantine, ever the savvy politician, backed the winning side...at first.

He exiled those who refused to sign the Nicene Creed, including his friend Eusebius of Nicomedia.

But only 2 yrs later, he rescinded their exile &amp; brought
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama Here are the actual Canons of Nicaea, the record of the official decisions made by the Council.
https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

Read them. Read them closely.
Not ONE mention of them compiling or editing the Bible. Not even a hint.

These are the records FROM THE COUNCIL OF NICAEA ITSELF
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama I don't need to "Google" books on the Council of Nicaea. I have read dozens of them.

I have read the actual Canons of Nicaea. I have read the writings of the men who were actually THERE at Nicaea. 

I have done ACTUAL research (iow, not just a "Google search") for over 30 yrs.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama I don't use the King James Version.

But Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with determining the content of the Bible.

And you have YET to show any evidence they ever DID.

(because no such evidence exists)
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama No one was disputing that Jesus was God's Son.

The dispute at Nicaea was what was MEANT by "Son of God".

The Arians thought it meant that he was the FIRST CREATION of God.

The Nicenes said it meant he was "of one Substance" (Homoousios) with the Father, equal in Divinity.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama Nope.

First of all, the pagan significance of December 25th is overstated.

Secondly, the date of and celebration of Christmas LONG predated Nicaea.

https://t.co/jSBq0OFEhX
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama Show me your evidence.
You can't. 

Because there ISN'T ANY!
There just ISN'T any evidence that Nicaea compiled or edited the Bible.

None. Zero. Zip. Nada.

Here, read these and get back to me:
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama The idea that the Council of Nicaea wrote, compiled, or otherwise chose the books of the Bible is an 18th Century myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code, and spread on the internet via memes and Social Media.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama Yes. I read it closely. I've read far more on this than you have. I have read the original source materials, the actual records of Nicaea, the writings of the men who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

No mention of them compiling the Bible or editing it's contents.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama You are STILL mistaken.

Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.

He was influenced by his sister, Flavia, an Arian sympathizer, and Eusebius of Nicomedia, a key ally of Arius.

He saw Arianism as easier to explain &amp; easier for former pagans to accept.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama You are mistaken in all counts.

First, the Council of Nicaea had NOTHING to do with the content of or make up of the Bible. Nothing at all.

Secondly, they did NOT invent the belief in Christ as the Son of God.
That was the belief of the Christian Church from the BEGINNING.
@joseph604 @ReynoldsTammy @itzruhama then back, making Eusebius of Nicomedia, the lead Arian bishop, his personal Spiritual Advisor.

And then, at Eusebius' urging, Constantine began persecuting Nicene bishops, deposing them and replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire.
@joycehand7777 In fact, the lead Bishop at the Council of Nicaea was a Black African from Alexandria, Egypt named Athanasius of Alexandria.

And the issue of the race, skin color, hair color, or eye color of Jesus WAS NOT something they discussed or dealt with at Nicaea.
@joycehand7777 What is it that makes you think that Constantine changed Jesus' race to white?

There were NO white people at the Council of Nicaea. They were ALL people of color. Africans, Copts, Syrians, Arabs Greeks, and Italians.
No Anglo-Saxons, French, Germans, Russians or Slavs there.
@just4whatever1 @Gehazi20492796 @smashbaals Then you should know that the Council of Nicaea was about the ARIAN CONTROVERSY, not setting the Canon of the Bible.

Nicaea had literally NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

They never even discussed it.
Look it up. It's not there. 
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@kane_daniel @Jmk5740 @pcalu @MarissaMMags The Council of Hippo was a LOCAL Synod that had only local jurisdiction. The Canon they set was just for the Diocese of Hippo.

But you were right that the Council of Nicaea had NOTHING to do with the Biblical Canon.
@karlnieberding The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing what books to include in the Bible.

That is a modern myth popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. It is Fiction.

The matter never even came up for discussion at Nicaea.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@katherinelou032 @MarshaBlackburn But it wasn't at Nicaea that the Bible was canonized. It wasn't ANY single Council, pope, or group. 

It wasn't an EVENT, but a long PROCESS that began in the 1st Century &amp; continued well into the 5th Century.
@katherinelou032 @MarshaBlackburn I agree with you on that matter.

I was just correcting your historical claims about the Bible and the Council of Nicaea.

On the rest of it, I completely agree with you. (I am Pro-Choice)
@katherinelou032 @MarshaBlackburn Please read the article that you yourself posted. 

It doesn't support what you said.
The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with selecting the Books of the Bible.

The issue of which books to include in the Bible never even came up for DISCUSSION, much less a vote.
@keola_lai @PanseyWarrior @iluminatibot 1. Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea chose the Books of the Bible. At all.

2. The Dead Sea Scrolls, found at Qumran, are an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT set of texts from the Gnostic Gospels, which were found at Nag Hamadi. The Dead Sea Scrolls were NOT the Gnostic Gospels.
@keola_lai @PanseyWarrior @iluminatibot 5. The story about the Council of Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible is an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire, popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code &amp; spread on the internet via memes &amp; Social Media. It is NOT true.

@kiritheone @TayloTodd @TessFromWessex @supermanxtream9 @cannoli1000 @AlanWAshton @SeptembersRain @TheBibleIsJesus @wadi_thevalley It was the first Ecumenical Church Council convened in 325 AD to resolve the Arian Controversy.

@klford7 @LakotaMan1 It's like people just blame anything they don't like or understand about Christianity on the Council of Nicaea. But they never bother to actually FACT CHECK their conspiracy theories to see what Nicaea was ACTUALLY about.

https://t.co/CJTedfMGtq
@klford7 @LakotaMan1 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with editing the Bible.

Reincarnation was never at ANY time part of Christian beliefs, nor was it an issue that was ever even dealt with at the Council of Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@klhicks912 Definitely!

I'm working on a novelization of the Council of Nicaea.

I'd love to travel to Alexandria, Egypt, Iznik, Turkey, and Istanbul (is Constantinople, 🎶now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople, been a long time gone, Constantinople 🎶), Turkey. https://t.co/xvUaoVhj9R
@koamac @NikkiNikkinow2 Well, since you asked. 

I have an advanced degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

I have read the original source materials for the Council of Nicaea.
I have studied the history of the canonization of the Bible for nearly 30 yrs.
@kootenayGreg Also, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with "editing", changing, or choosing the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
They never even discussed the matter at Nicaea much less decided on it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@kraade @lastrealhumans No, they didn't &amp; The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding what books would be included in the Bible.

@kshartel @revlucymeg My apologies for misunderstanding where you were coming from.

Didn't mean to "mansplain" you.

There's just a lot of misinformation about Nicaea and the Biblical Canon.

Sorry for the intrusion.

Please carry on.
@kshartel @revlucymeg The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing OR "chucking" the books if the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
The issue of what books to include in the Bible never came up for discussion, much less a vote at Nicaea.
@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba Again, Nicaea had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with choosing or removing any writings from the Bible.

It simply wasn't even an issue at Nicaea. There's no indication from the records that they ever even DISCUSSED including or excluding any books from the Bible at all.
@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba And, ironically, the ones who ended up being persecuted by the Roman Government were the TRINITARIANS, who prevailed at Nicaea.

Constantine himself actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea. He was influenced by his sister, Flavia, who was an Arian sympathizer, and
@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba At Eusebius' urging, Constantine began to persecuted Nicene bishops, deposing them &amp; replacing them with Arian bishops in key Sees throughout the Empire.

@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba I am a Christian, and I know a great deal about the Council of Nicaea.

I have a degree in History and a Master's with a focus in Church History.

The Council of Nicaea did NOT write the Bible or choose the books of the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba It took another 56 yrs and another Church Council in 381 AD, in Constantinople, called by Emperor Theodosius I, to finally defeat Arianism within the Empire.

Constantine fought FOR Arianism, he didn't persecute them. He persecuted Nicene Trinitarians.
@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba When the Council drafted the Nicene Creed, Constantine favored compromise wording that would have allowed the Arians to agree to it. But the Council chose the famous "Homoousios" wording which the Arians could NOT agree to. Constantine went along with it &amp; exiled his friend
@kushjermaine @MuddyP80 @Johnstoneyy @_Rasshumba continued the policy of enforced Arianization, replacing Nicene bishops with Arian bishops. In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power &amp; influence in the years after Nicaea, prompting St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"
@kwesidansog @GhanaSocialU @BlackSwan_00001 @MarvinBoateng13 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "compiling" the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
They never even discussed the issue, much less decided it.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy, not compiling the Bible.
@larryjordanauth Eusebius of Caesarea's Canon (300-320 AD prior to the Council of Nicaea)

4 Gospels &amp; Acts
13 Pauline Epistles
James
1 Peter
1 John

He rejected Revelation, 2 Peter, 2 &amp; 3 John and was "iffy" about Hebrews and Jude.
@larryjordanauth Even the term "Trinity" was coined 150 yrs BEFORE Nicaea.

The essentials of the Doctrine were preached from the beginning.

What developed over time was the precise Theological TERMINOLOGY used to describe those beliefs.
@larryjordanauth Nicaea was a step in the process of the development of the hierarchy.

It didn't fundamentally change ANY practice or belief of the Church.

The Christian faith before Nicaea is fundamentally IDENTICAL to the faith proclaimed AT Nicaea.

Nicaea didn't deal with the Biblical Canon
@larryjordanauth So you see, quite a bit is actually known about the Early Church between Jesus and the Council of Nicaea. We know how they lived, who many of them were, what they believed, and how they worshipped.
@larryjordanauth They aren't formal Creeds, no, but they are STATEMENTS OF BELIEF taken from their actual writings.

That's the point. These demonstrate what the Early Christians ACTUALLY BELIEVED before Nicaea.
@larryjordanauth What was formalized at Nicaea was the beginnings of the Patriarchal system, naming Rome, Alexandria and Antioch. 

The Council of Constantinople rounded out that system by adding the bishops of Constantinople and Jerusalem to make the 5 Great Patriarchs of Christianity.
@larue_eugene @itzruhama The New Testament writings, as well as the writings of the Early Church Fathers existed LONG before Nicaea. We have extant copies of the NT dating to the 2nd Century and other writings earlier than that.

So, no. Jesus was NOT "made up" at the Council of Nicaea
@linatheartist The idea of the Trinity was NOT "introduced by the Council of Nicaea". It was taught from the very beginning, long before Nicaea. It was taught in Scripture &amp; by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries.
It was DEFENDED &amp;CLARIFIED at Nicaea. https://t.co/jXDmvi3RMf
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert Actually, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be excluded. 

That is a modern Myth popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. It never actually happened.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert Can you show me in the historical records where it says ANYWHERE that the Council of Nicaea picked which books to include or exclude from the Bible?
No, you can't. Because they didn't.
The Canonization of the Bible was not an event, but a process, and the Council of Nicaea wasn't
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert No, because the ACTUAL HISTORICAL RECORD says so.

I've read the actual records from the Council of Nicaea, the 20 Canons.

I've read the writings of the people who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

I've read the Gnostic Gospels and many other ancient writings from that time.
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert Nope. Just the extant Historical records. 

Show me ONE place where it says the Council of Nicaea voted on the Books to include in the Bible.

You can't. Because they didn't.
The myth that Nicaea picked the books of the Bible was started in the 18th Century by Voltaire. It was
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert Sigh. 

The Council of Nicaea had literally NOTHING to do with deciding what books to include in the Bible.

That is a modern Conspiracy Theory popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

It never happened.

The matter never even came up for discussion at Nicaea.
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert The Canon of Scripture remained an open question till the late 5th Century, over 100 yrs after Nicaea. And it wasn't an event or a Council that decided. It was a more gradual, organic process of the consensus of ALL the churches over a period of about 500 yrs.
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert Then you know that there is NO evidence whatsoever that the Council of Nicaea ever even discussed which books to include in the Bible, much less voted on it.
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert There's ZERO evidence from any of the original source materials of the Council of Nicaea even addressing the issue of what books to include in or exclude from the Bible.
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert Yeah. Like the actual Canons of the Council of Nicaea? Yeah. I've read them. All 20 of them.

Luke the writings of the people who were actually THERE at Nicaea? I've read them. Alexander of Alexandria, Athanasius of Alexandria, Arius, Eusebius of Caesarea, Eusebius of Nicomedia,
@live2tell_x @laurenboebert and even Constantine himself.

I've also read all of the Gnostic Gospels and numerous other ancient writings that were circulating at the same time.

No mention anywhere of the Council of Nicaea discussing, voting on,bit deciding which books to include in the Bible.
@livetogro @beledbylove @hey_itsAR This is a statement of FAITH, not facts.

And it is fine for YOU personally to believe that.

But to say that before Nicaea the actual Christian belief was the same as yours is simply FACTUALLY FALSE! https://t.co/yaeDhkckEc
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove Also, he did NOT change the beliefs of Christianity.

The evidence of the Pre-Nicene Church Fathers indicates that the beliefs of Christianity BEFORE Nicaea were pretty much identical to the beliefs AFTER Nicaea.
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove Jesus was proclaimed as Divine from the VERY BEGINNING of the Christian faith!

Belief in the Deity of Christ LONG predates the Council of Nicaea. It was taught in Scripture and preached by the Early Church Fathers from the 1st Century forward.

It was NOT "invented" at Nicaea.
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove No, I worship God alone.

You are avoiding the obvious fact that you have NO FACTUAL BASIS for claiming that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

You haven't provided ANY evidence whatsoever that the Christian belief before Nicaea was that Jesus was just a man.
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove Until you proved SOME factual basis for your claims that the Council of Nicaea determined the Canon of the Bible (they didn't) or that the general Christian belief before Nicaea was that Jesus was merely human and not Divine (it wasn't), you are just MAKING IT UP OUT OF NOTHING.
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove What is your basis for saying that the Council of Nicaea chose the Books of the Bible?

You have still never answered that question.

You keep changing the subject instead.

Just answer the question.

I've answered every question you have asked ME.

It's your turn.
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove Yet you seem perfectly willing to make completely UNSUBSTANTIATED claims about what happened there. 🤔

My statements are based on the ACTUAL HISTORICAL RECORDS from Nicaea, and the testimonies of the people who were actually THERE at Nicaea.

What are YOUR claims based on?
@livetogro @hey_itsAR @beledbylove You are moving the goalposts. 

Jesus Christ alone is my Savior.

That has absolutely NOTHING to do with whether the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible, or whether Constantine imposed pagan beliefs on Christianity.

You have ZERO basis for such claims.
@livetogro How about YOU provide ANY documentary or factual basis for ANY of the claims you are making about what happened at Nicaea, or what the Christian faith believed before Nicaea.
I have showed you the factual, documentary basis for my claims.

What are YOUR claims based on?
Anything?
@livetogro Yes. Of course he is.

But this isn't a question of whether we trust in Christ for our Salvation or not.
You are making false Historical claims about what happened at the Council of Nicaea, and claiming WITHOUT EVIDENCE that Constantine imposed pagan beliefs on Christianity.
@lovineleven @klpaint1960 @FritziRoss The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with picking which books to include in the Bible.

@lukeamazooka It's not necessarily Heretical, but it is an unauthorized, unnecessary, and damaging addition to the Creed. 

It creates more problems than it solves, and it split the Church.

The original text of the Nicene-Constantinople Creed is sufficient.
@madmadworld68 @Tim13579242 @HeatherRose24 @mean_toe @LiveDie4Jesus Constantine didn't change the nature, beliefs, or practices of the Christian Religion. He didn't impose pagan practices or beliefs.

In fact, far from inventing the Religion, the bishops at Nicaea DEFENDED &amp; CLARIFIED the Religion as it had already existed FROM THE BEGINNING!
@madmadworld68 @Tim13579242 @HeatherRose24 @mean_toe @LiveDie4Jesus The Council of Nicaea NEVER voted on the Bible or made ANY decisions whatsoever regarding the content of the Bible.

@maklelan It is a widely believed modern myth that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible, edited it &amp; compiled it.

That's absolutely NOT true!

In fact, that idea comes from an 18th Century Myth started by the philosopher Voltaire &amp; popularized by the novel The DaVinci Code.
@marcbel19406167 @At0micTh0mas @FrogEmperor2 No one was burned or executed at the Council of Nicaea or as a result of it.
@marko_dannie @MariSinclaire Christ was worshipped as Divine from the very beginning of the Christian faith.

The Scriptures declare his Divinity.
The Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Century also proclaimed belief in his Divinity.

The Council of Nicaea didn't "invent" the idea. They DEFENDED it.
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 And no, the New Testament was NOT "commissioned" at the Council of Nicaea. 
There is ZERO evidence of this.
I call your bluff and say PROVE IT!
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 Both the Doctrine of the Trinity and the celebration of Easter (Pascha) LONG preceded Nicaea.

Easter celebrations date to the 2nd Century, and belief in the Divinity of Christ &amp; the Trinity date to the 1st Century. https://t.co/BCdDkOtuxq
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 But if you want further evidence that the Council of Nicaea DIDN'T choose the books of the Bible, here's the actual records from the Council Nicaea itself. 

https://t.co/H3KvZmzAL9

Read them yourself. Nothing about choosing the books of the Bible.
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 First of all, the 50 Bibles commissioned by Constantine to Eusebius of Caesarea DIDN'T happen at Nicaea, but nearly a decade after.
2nd, Constantine DIDN'T tell Eusebius WHICH books to include.
And Eusebius' Canon would have been DIFFERENT from our current Bible.
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 How does that prove that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible?

What are you talking about?
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 No. My evidence is the historical evidence I presented in the post BEFORE that.

The "movie script" evidence is what YOU are using to claim that Nicaea chose the books of the Bible

Here's the story of how that myth came about:
https://t.co/DseHAMbhKM
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 Nope. You have ZERO evidence of this. You are just making it up out of nothing. No Historical records anywhere supports ANY of your claims. 
Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.
He backed the Niceans when they turned against Arius, but reneged on that
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 Nothing you have said even comes CLOSE to proving that the Council of Nicaea had ANYTHING to do with determining the content of the New Testament.

You are flailing around making unsubstantiated claims and spouting Conspiracy Theories WITHOUT EVIDENCE. 

YOU are making things up.
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 Ok. First, I'm NOT am Evangelical OR an Adventist.

The website I linked to WASN'T an Evangelical/Adventist source. It was a CATHOLIC source that included the original records from the Council of Nicaea.

That you don't know that means you didn't even LOOK at the contents.
@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T "put the Bible together". 

That is a common misconception.

In fact, they didn't even DISCUSS the matter of the Canon of the Bible at Nicaea.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 This isn't "revisionist History" it IS History.

@matthew_sali @TJadlow @BowmanJessamine @Truthbe29182889 @luxury_pizza @AtheistIntelli2 Why does that have ANYTHING to do with proving the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible??

That God created the universe DOESN'T mean the New Testament was canonized at Nicaea.

What is your reasoning here?
@meanRonDean @peppy_not @Agility_Fan @LakotaMan1 The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which Books to include in the Bible.

@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram But, ever the savvy politician, Constantine backed the winning side in the end. 

He even agreed to exile all those who refused to sign the Nicene Creed, including his friend, Eusebius of Nicomedia.

But a short 2 yrs later, he rescinded their exile &amp; made Eusebius of Nicomedia
@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram It is not speculating to say he preferred the Arians. He felt that Arius' ideas were easier to understand and easier for former pagans to accept. He was pragmatic.

And, being influenced by both his sister and by Eusebius of Nicomedia, he favored the Arians before Nicaea.
@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram Nope. Actually Constantine favored the ARIANS in the lead up to Nicaea.

Far from "strong arming" them, the Council actually voted AGAINST his wishes!

He was close with Eusebius of Nicomedia, the lead Arian bishop, and the Emperor's sister, Flavia, was an Arian sympathizer.
@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram We have the testimony of later Nicene Christians, particularly St. Jerome regarding the resurgence of Arianism due to Imperial support after Nicaea.

This is in the historical records. It is what happened after Nicaea.
@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram his personal Spiritual Advisor. At Eusebius' urging, Constantine began persecuting Nicene Christianity, deposing Nicene bishops &amp; replacing them with Arian bishops.

They deposed Athanasius of Alexandria no fewer than FIVE TIMES!

His sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, continued
@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram that policy of enforced Arianization after Constantine's death.

Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea, prompting St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

It took another 56 yrs &amp; another Church Council in 381 AD
@minouroufail @DustanHowell @ecafsub @cheradanine @davramdavram to finally defeat Arianism within the Empire.

So Constantine DIDN'T "strong arm" the Council of Nicaea. They vote AGAINST his wishes.

@moxlloyd @officialteewhy_ @_nayrb_18 @EXDOESTHAT @RealLathan 5th, Nicaea didn't INVENT or change the Christian teaching on Jesus. Christ's Divinity was preached from the 1st Century forward. Nicaea DEFENDED and CLARIFIED the belief, they didn't invent it.
@moxlloyd @officialteewhy_ @_nayrb_18 @EXDOESTHAT @RealLathan Okay, first, Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 326. 

2nd, Constantine was EMPEROR, not Prince.

3rd, Constantine actually favored the ARIANS, who denied the Divinity of Christ, in the lead up to Nicaea.

4th, belief in the Divinity of Christ goes all the way back to the 1st Century.
@mpumegama78 @SahnunMurabit @ntsikimazwai @PoohmeDJ @Teboho_Ranks Arius, and an advisor to the Emperor.

It was Eusebius of Nicomedia who first appealed to Constantine to intervene on behalf of Arius, who had been condemned at 2 different Synods in Alexandria.

Ultimately, the Council of Nicaea condemned Arius and his teachings.
@mridgaf1999 @HenryJBaugh @Since19854 @223Quis @DelbertGSeasons @oldmanebro "Jesus" is not a "nickname the Romans gave him".

Jesus comes from the New Testament Greek of his name, Ιησούς, or "Iesous". "Jesus" is the English version of that name.

Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea.
@occupation_lie @CrushunYoo @AmYisraelChai07 @Hleowstede @BrotherAugusti2 @realjosephb What happened was that the men at Nicaea DEFENDED the Divinity of Christ against the false teachings of Arius.

@rcurry95 @Giovann73764108 @geostylegeo No it is NOT a "fact" that Athanasius "compiled the Bible" in 367 AD. 

Ratger, he set the Canon FOR THE DIOCESE OF ALEXANDRIA ONLY in 367 AD.

It is also a fact that the Canonization process began centuries BEFORE Nicaea &amp; wasn't complete until well into the 5th Century
@rcurry95 @Giovann73764108 @geostylegeo That being said, The Council of Nicaea was NOT about Gnosticism OR about censoring those books from the Bible.

Neither Constantine, nor Athanasius "removed" the Gnostic Gospels from the Bible.

Those books were never even in consideration for inclusion in the Bible at any time.
@rcurry95 @pattyorchard @Giovann73764108 @geostylegeo The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books were orthodox and which were not.

They never even discussed the Gospel of Mary at Nicaea, much less declared it unorthodox.

All of that is from the DaVinci Code, not actual History.
@rdcopple @eklekton_son @FoxNews The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with selecting the books of the Bible.

It's NOT true.
@realMB821 @last_starfiter @WhitlockJason None of that is actually true.
The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T write OR codify the New Testament.

In fact, the issue of the New Testament Canon never even came up at Nicaea.
And neither Easter, nor Christmas, nor Sunday Worship are actually pagan.

That myth was first advanced by Pope Gregory I in the late 6th Century.

Nicaea had nothing to do with it.
@reblambourn @RachelBitecofer At Eusebius' urging Constantine began persecuting Nicene bishops, deposing them and replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire.

His sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, continued this policy of enforced Arianization.

Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea.
@reblambourn @RachelBitecofer That is NOT what happened.

In fact, in the lead up to Nicaea, Constantine actually favored the ARIANS. He felt that Arianism was easier to explain &amp; easier for former pagans to accept.

The Council, however, voted AGAINST his preferred group.
Ever the savvy politician he backed
@reblambourn @RachelBitecofer The Council of Nicaea didn't CHANGE any essential belief of Christianity. They didn't INVENT the Trinity or the idea that Jesus is Divine.

@reblambourn @RachelBitecofer the winning side, agreeing to exile those who refused to sign the Nicene Creed, even his friend Eusebius of Nicomedia.

But soon after Nicaea, he reneged on that support, bringing the Arians back, making the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor

@rkdoctr @LaniMil07904322 @Morgan47906715 @NickAdamsinUSA I do believe that God exists.

But whether or not God exists, there are certain historical facts that are true.

1. The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with forming the Bible
2. A Literal Interpretation of Genesis is NOT the normative Christian belief over 2k yrs
@rkdoctr @LaniMil07904322 @Morgan47906715 @NickAdamsinUSA I never proposed to you that I could or would prove the existence of God to you.

That is YOUR issue, not mine.

You are the one making the existence of God an issue. Not me.
@rkdoctr @LaniMil07904322 @Morgan47906715 @NickAdamsinUSA I'm not talking about believing in the content of the Bible. That's a different issue.

I'm just talking about the history of how the Bible was canonized and compiled.

Historically, the Council of Nicaea DID NOT decide on the Canon of the Bible.

Nicaea was about ARIANISM.
@robotoilchange @WasLuther @HeedWhoIs @file_49 @JackPosobiec Gnosticism mostly died out except for a few isolated pockets by the late 3rd Century.

By the time Nicaea came along, it had already ceased to be a major issue in the Church. 

No force or Church Council needed to defeat them.
@robotoilchange @WasLuther @HeedWhoIs @file_49 @JackPosobiec Here are the FACTS:
1. There were several major Heretical groups in the first 300 yrs before Nicaea
2. Every single one of them were condemned and faded away without the use of force OR a Church Council.
3. The only weapons they had were polemical writings &amp; excommunication.
@robotoilchange @WasLuther @HeedWhoIs @file_49 @JackPosobiec Of course there is!

@rojocaliente1 @KellieADennis74 A temporary measure that was rescinded 2 short yrs later.

And the Constantine made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor and started persecuting Nicene Christians.
@rojocaliente1 @KellieADennis74 No censorship happened at the Council of Nicaea.
@rojocaliente1 @KellieADennis74 Yes. In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power in the years after Nicaea.

Constantine, and after his death, his sons, Constans &amp; Constantius II, began deposing Nicene bishops and replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire.

They definitely EXPLICITLY taught the Deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit while insisting
@seekthrtruth @noah_nonsense @ifffster The only thing established at Nicaea was the precise Theological TERMINOLOGY used to describe the belief which long predated Nicaea.

So when they speak of "the formulation", they are speaking of this development of precise Theological TERMINOLOGY...not the belief itself.
@seekthrtruth @noah_nonsense @ifffster The terminology had been developing over centuries. Tertullian in the 2nd Century coined the term "Trinity". Origen in the 3rd Century developed the terms "hypostasis" (Persons) and "Ousia" (Essence/Substance).

Nicaea introduced the term "Homoousios" (of the same Substance).
@serebrenitska What in the world are you talking about?

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with changing the facts in the Bible.

Also, this "facts sheet" was just something the publisher of that particular Bible added for study purposes. It wasn't actually part of the text.

@silo_hr And the Bishops who attended the Council of Nicaea were all Greeks, Syrians, Turks, and Africans. Not an Anglo Saxon among them.
@silo_hr Why do you think they were white?
Athanasius, the leader of the Trinitarians at the Council of Nicaea, was African, and described as dark skinned. Alexander of Alexandria &amp; Arius were also both North Africans. Most of the rest were Greeks and Syrians, Turkish, etc.
@skaroko @waluwande No, the two Creeds are not related.

Acts
1 Peter
James
Jude
1 John

These all were recognized widely as Scripture by the early 2nd Century, LONG before the Council of Nicaea.

@tooshortCary @MadTheo096 @Bro89290681 @ugroyp @MaroneBoderato I believe he meant that someone at Nicaea QUOTED from Judith, acknowledging it to be Scripture. Not that the Council voted on the matter.
@trANsTIFAnj @RealBrysonGray Actually, the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with determining which books would be included in the Bible and which would be excluded. 

That is a modern Myth popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. It never actually happened.

@travisofGlasgow @Dayton_Coates @EristocracyTV The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing what books to include in the Bible.

That is a modern myth popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. It is Fiction.

The matter never even came up for discussion at Nicaea.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@tukEk88 @Nick_H_110177 @ElyseGotham @nathaliejacoby1 The Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T leave out ANY booksThe fact is that the Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with deciding which books to include in the Bible.

The subject of the Biblical Canon never even came up at Nicaea.

https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@unDawn_ted @WaydeDelafield @KariLake The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "inventing the Bible".

And the claim that they "invented Jesus" is simply ridiculous. Christ had been preached for 300 yrs before Nicaea. He was even preached as the DIVINE SON OF GOD from the 1st Century forward. https://t.co/KRYgPHyju4
@understand111 Nether Constantine nor the Council of Nicaea actually had ANYTHING to do with compiling the Bible.

That is a common misconception. They never even discussed the matter at Nicaea much less decided on it.
Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible
https://t.co/CJTedg4PHy
@unprovabletruth @babydoll747 Because Nicaea didn't deal with the content of the Bible. The issue never even came up for discussion.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.

Also, we have Biblical manuscripts dating to over a Century before Nicaea. We know they didn't change it.
@upstart_rising @Amen_Baba_ Wasn't trying to convince you of anything.

Just wanted to correct some common misconceptions about the Council of Nicaea.

People get bad information and draw bad conclusions based on it.
It's always good to get the facts straight.
@utsdoc Don't you hate it when those same old tired Conspiracy Theories keep cropping up?

And then they try to tell YOU, of all people, what the Council of Nicaea was all about? 😂
@uwakwe_israel The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with creating the Bible.

That is a common misconception.

Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
https://t.co/CJTedg4hS0
@vg_ell @TheLiberalPoet Constantine didn't influence the Council.

The faith expressed by the Nicene Creed is the same faith that was expressed BEFORE Nicaea.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@vg_ell @TheLiberalPoet None of that is true.
The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with "establishing the Bible". The matter never even came up at Nicaea.

And there were NO pagans or Non-christian scholars at Nicaea. Only Christian bishops and their Deacons &amp; Assistants were in attendance
@vg_ell @joejrgarcia1971 @obeyjess925 That's a common misconception.
The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with "compiling the Bible."

That is a modern myth started in the 18th Century and popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

https://t.co/ZCW9ejMp3c
@viedarling It's not a coincidence at all... because the Council of Nicaea actually DIDN'T remove any books from the Bible or have anything whatsoever to do with deciding which books to include in or exclude from the Bible.

That is a common misconception.
@viedarling No problem.

The myth about the Council of Nicaea choosing the books of the Bible tracks back to the 18th Century philosopher Voltaire, and it was popularized in recent yrs by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code. Then it spread on the internet via memes and Social Media.
@void_bearcat Please read the article you yourself posted.

Because it doesn't say ANYWHERE that the Council of Nicaea edited the books of the Bible.

Read the section called "Misconceptions". It says, "There is no record of any discussion of the biblical canon at the Council."
@wagners_ring @nathaliejacoby1 What did the Council of Nicaea do that ruined Religion for you?
@waluwande The Apostles Creed &amp; the Nicene Creed are two different things.

The Council of Nicaea had nothing to do with the Apostles Creed. The original wording of the Nicene Creed was drafted and approved at Nicaea. It was amended to it's current form in 381 AD at Constantinople.
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 7. The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing the books of the Bible. The fact is that the subject of the Canon of the Bible never even came up for DISCUSSION at Nicaea much less a decision. Nicaea was about the Arian Controversy NOT the Bible.
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 Again, you are all over the place. 

Yes, power corrupted men of the Church. That is a given. Happens every single time the Church gets in bed with Government.

But the Council of Nicaea DID NOT fundamentally alter the beliefs or practices of Christianity, nor of the Bible.
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 And at the time of the Council of Nicaea, the Papacy as we know it today had not yet developed. The Bishop of Rome was considered more of an "Elder Brother" among EQUALS, rather than the head of the entire Church.

In fact, Canons 6 &amp; 7 of Nicaea explicitly spelled this out. https://t.co/HkfxXkSis4
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 Ever the savvy politician, Constantine backed the Niceans at the Council. But he reneged on that support shortly after Nicaea. Yes, he exiled Arius and the handful of Arians who refused to sign the Nicene Creed. But he rescinded that exile a short 2 yrs later.
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 He brought them back and made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor. And then, at Eusebius' urging, began persecuting Nicene bishops, deposing them and replacing them with Arian bishops across the Empire. His son, Constantius II, continued
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 I can prove it to you.
1. Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 335
2. We have Greek Manuscripts of all of the New Testament books dating to the 2nd or 3rd Century, LONG before Nicaea.
3. We have quotations of the NT from the Early Church Fathers dating to the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries.
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 The Council of Nicaea was NOT in Rome, it was in modern day Iznik, Turkey.

And, while the Emperor Constantine called the Council of Nicaea and sat as it's ceremonial chair, he actually had no vote or direct input in the decisions of the Council. In fact, he favored the ARIANS,
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 You are moving the goalposts.

We are talking about the Council of Nicaea here. Not about whether you think Jesus existed or not.

You are so concerned for "evidence" of Jesus &amp; yet YOU yourself make unsubstantiated claims and conspiracy theories about Nicaea AGAINST all evidence
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 in the lead up to Nicaea, influenced by his sister, Flavia Constantia, an Arian sympathizer, and his advisor, Eusebius of Nicomedia, the lead Arian bishop.

Yet the Council turned against Arius from the very first session and ultimately condemned him.
@warrior_covfefe @YWHisKing @thompsonb2569 this policy after his death. In fact, Arianism actually GREW in power after Nicaea, prompting St. Jerome to famously lament, "The whole world groaned, and was astonished to find itself Arian!"

It took another 56 yrs and another Church Council to finally defeat Arianism.
@wendykayeauthor @Robofemoid @iluminatibot Perhaps you should actually research it. Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING whatsoever to do with the makeup of the Bible.

Or with Freemasonry for that matter.
@west_ofthemores Historical drama about the events leading up to the Council of Nicaea
@whatep @BeatTheCult Actually, belief in the Divinity of Christ was preached from the beginning of the Christian faith.

Not only us it proclaimed in the Scriptures, it was preached by the Early Church Fathers of the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries, LONG before Nicaea. https://t.co/I6jrhRrpqP
@wildpinkrose69 @jur4ssicparkour To be REALLY fair, the Council of Nicaea actually had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with determining the Canon of the Bible.

The Council of Nicaea was about dealing with the Arian Controversy, NOT determining the make up of the Bible.
@william_priebe The Council of Nicaea actually had absolutely NOTHING to do with choosing which books to include in the Bible.

@winterpeg117 @LillianHellman3 @durbinwatson09 @jasonselvig Also the Historical facts about where the belief in the Deity of Christ came from. It was NOT "invented" at Nicaea, but was believed and taught by the Christian community from the VERY BEGINNING of the Christian faith in the 1st Century.
@winterpeg117 @LillianHellman3 @durbinwatson09 @jasonselvig I have the actual Historical records of how the Bible was canonized.
I can show you step by step the process over nearly 500 yrs.

And I can show you the writings of the Early Christians from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries affirming their belief in the Deity of Christ BEFORE Nicaea
@winterpeg117 @LillianHellman3 @durbinwatson09 @jasonselvig No, they explicitly believed that he was in fact God Incarnate, as had been taught from the very beginning of the Christian faith.

The doctrine of the Trinity &amp; the Deity of Christ LONG predated Nicaea. The idea was NOT "invented" at Nicaea.
It was what had been taught all along
@winterpeg117 @LillianHellman3 @durbinwatson09 @jasonselvig The Deity of Christ is taught in Scripture and was declared by the Early Christians in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Centuries, LONG before Nicaea.

Nicaea only clarified and codified the belief of Christianity that had already been believed for 300 yrs BEFORE Nicaea.
@wisemanryder @YtPhuck @Logic1425 @bibi2_james @visegrad24 Contrary to popular myth, Constantine actually favored the ARIANS in the lead up to the Council of Nicaea, and only backed the Trinitarians after it became clear that the Council had turned solidly against Arius from the very first session.

He later reneged on that support and

@wisemanryder @YtPhuck @Logic1425 @bibi2_james @visegrad24 What do you mean?
Are you asking how many people were there at Nicaea? 
Or how many Church Councils have there been?
@wisemanryder @YtPhuck @Logic1425 @bibi2_james @visegrad24 When the Council went against his preferences, ever the cunning politician, Constantine backed the winning side.
Those who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were exiled from the Empire.

But Constantine rescinded the exile a scant 2 yrs later. He brought the Arians back &amp; he made
@wisemanryder @YtPhuck @Logic1425 @bibi2_james @visegrad24 began supporting the Arians again only a few yrs after Nicaea.
He didn't impose his will on the Council of Nicaea. They actually voted AGAINST his wishes on the Arian controversy.
@wisemanryder @YtPhuck @Logic1425 @bibi2_james @visegrad24 in Nicaea (modern day İznik, Turkey), to resolve the matter once and for all.

Over 300 bishops from across the Empire met at Nicaea in 325 AD to decide the issue.

Constantine was the ceremonial chair of the Council, but he actually had no vote or role in the actual Council.
@wisemanryder @YtPhuck @Logic1425 @bibi2_james @visegrad24 the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, whom he had been close to before Nicaea, his personal Spiritual Advisor.

It was Eusebius of Nicomedia who had urged Constantine to call the Council in the first place.
@wjreidini @ArgenTo46 @SwordoftheSaint @schizodove Here are the Canons of Nicaea, the record of the decisions made by the Council.

https://t.co/H3KvZmz2VB

No mention anywhere of deciding the Canon of Scripture. Not even a hint of it.

The Council of Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING to do with the Canonization process. Nothing.

@xLittleLlama @dianeski @okihearyou @PastorAlexLove It is what was believed from the beginning. It is Apostolic teaching.
It is most definitely taught in Scripture.

It wasn't invented by the Council of Nicaea.
It isn't added Doctrine.
It is "the Faith Once Delivered to the Saints".
@xLittleLlama @dianeski @okihearyou @PastorAlexLove This is not true. 
First, the Council of Nicaea was in 325 AD, not 500.

Second, belief in the Deity of Christ dates to the VERY BEGINNING of Christianity. The Early Church Fathers from the 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd Centuries all believed Jesus was God. https://t.co/5vnhNpNEw1

Common misconceptions about the Council of Nicaea.

1. The Council of Nicaea DID NOT determine which books to include in the Bible. That issue wasn't even DISCUSSED much less voted on or decided.
2. Constantine DID NOT dictate the decisions of the Council. In fact, he favored
Common myths about the Trinity.

1. It was NOT "invented" at the Council of Nicaea. Belief in the Trinity long predated Nicaea.
2. It is NOT a "pagan corruption" of Christian Doctrine. The Trinity is NOT a pagan concept.
3. It is NOT a belief in 3 Gods. The Trinity is ONE God.
Contrary to popular myth, the Council of Nicaea and Emperor Constantine actually had NOTHING whatsoever to do with choosing what books to include in the Bible.

That is a modern Conspiracy Theory popularized by Dan Brown's novel The DaVinci Code.

It never happened.
Done people have asked me why I keep posting about and harping on the Council of Nicaea, correcting common misconceptions about it and the Biblical Canon.

There are SO many people who have gotten bad information about this on the internet via memes and Social Media posts.
Holidays across the Empire.
The Council also resolved a conflict regarding the way the date of Easter was calculated. There were 2 competing formulas and the Council chose one of them to be used by all churches.
5. No heretics were killed or executed after Nicaea. The bishops
It is NOT true that the Council of Nicaea chose the books of the Bible.

It is NOT true that Christianity, or even Jesus himself were "invented" at Nicaea.

It is NOT true that the Trinity, Easter, Christmas, and Sunday morning worship were of pagan origins imposed on the Church.
It isn't even true that Constantine imposed his own ideas in the Council of Nicaea and molded Christianity according to his own desires. He actually supported the ARIANS, who LOST at Nicaea, and only backed the Niceans once it was clear the Council had turned firmly against Arius
No books were removed from the Bible at Nicaea. Not were there alterations made to the Bible.

In fact, Nicaea had absolutely NOTHING AT ALL to do with choosing the books of the Bible.

That's a common misconception. https://t.co/ic8dWsbe7Y
Seriously, people just blame ANYTHING they don't like or understand in Christianity on the COUNCIL OF NICAEA &amp; think there were all these nefarious intentions &amp; Conspiracies.

Y'all, Google is free. You can do a quick search and see NONE of that is true!
The Trinitarians within a few yrs after Nicaea and started supporting the Arians again and began persecuting &amp; deposing Trinitarian bishops.
3. The Trinity was NOT "invented" at Nicaea. The belief LONG predated Nicaea, dating back to the 1st Century. Constantine himself preferred

the ARIANS (who LOST at Nicaea), in the lead up to Nicaea, and he only backed the Trinitarians after it became clear that the Council had turned against Arius from the very first session. The Council voted AGAINST Constantine's wishes.
Constantine later RENEGED on his support for
the easier to understand and explain Arianism. He felt Arianism was easier for uneducated former pagans to accept.
4. The Council of Nicaea DID NOT impose Sunday worship or celebrations of Christmas &amp; Easter on Christianity.

Christians had been worshipping on Sundays since the
we're rejected. In the end, only a handful of Bishops, together with the Presbyter Arius, were deposed and exiled.
7. Arianism was NOT destroyed by the Council of Nicaea. In fact, in the years after Nicaea, Arianism actually GREW in influence &amp; power because of the intervention
who refused to sign the Nicene Creed were deposed from their positions in the Church and exiled from the Empire. But 2 short yrs later, Constantine rescinded the Exile and brought them back. He even made the lead Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia, his personal Spiritual Advisor

@AmaOtsiwah @joyfultheology @ifffster I have exegeted some of those already, and have already demonstrated the triunity of God in Genesis alone.

So, you are Oneness?
It's not a false doctrine, but many people cannot even define it correctly. Most mean Nicaea and the like.
@AndrewFisherma2 Utterly false about the first generation of Christians.

But re: your first sentence is almost always a category error. (People usually mean 'Nicaea,' or the like.)

Allegiance to the triune God makes one a Christian, but the philosophical words one affirms have some flexibility.
@Apocalips2030 Trinity is a later coinage which means: 
"three-who/that-are-one."
That's everywhere in the Bible.

Nicaea isn't the Trinity.
Psalm 33:6 is.
Matthew 28:19 is.
1 Corinthians 12:4-6 is.
@BirminghamScot2 He was more precise than that: "that which is written." Past tense. Arguably encompassing inspired Scripture of his time as well (the NT). But not encompassing non-Apostolic writing.

No, I agree with every word of Nicaea.
I just endeavor, too, to comport with God's ecclesiology.
@CodornicesPark @ScoullarCraig Not true, actually. Take it from someone who deeply researched the OT Hebrew syntax.

The *doctrine* of the Trinity is from the *post*-NT era (Nicaea). But the triunity of God is certainly in Genesis. Ancient Jews were [biblical] Trinitarians. They just didn't use that word.
@Demi_Irawo @NathanNwanji Not something like Nicaea, sure.
But God's revelation of His triunity is even in Genesis.

Elohim and Ruah-Elohim in the first 2 verses.

Debar-YHWH (The Word/Logos) in v.3 but more explicitly after. The Word's visible manifestation (The Mal'ak) called "YHWH" in Gen 16:13.

So.
@EthanBarger @sonofammiel @InspiringPhilos If you commit the category error of thinking "Trinity = Nicaea," then your conclusions will be as wrong as yours just have been.

The triunity of God is in Genesis, for God's sake! And I don't mean a pithy appeal to 1:26. But 8-9 visible theophanies! "YHWH".
@EthanBarger @sonofammiel @InspiringPhilos Your last sentence, surprisingly after your categorically false statement at the beginning, was correct! Apparently you haven't connected the dots here, probably due to the very common conflation of 'the doctrine' with Nicaea.

YHWH manifest in visible form WAS what was going on.
@KantWasBaltic @Apocalips2030 or the triunity of God, we might say.

"Doctrine" means a range of things, but the way I hear it most used is "the formal formulation and codification of it at Nicaea." If we look for *that*, we of course won't find it.
@Katapetasma2 When are you going to stop these false explanations, Katapetasma?

The Scriptures are earlier than Nicaea, and they demonstrate your contention is thoroughly false.

James 3:1 applies to any who would set themselves up as Teachers. Be warned: you will be judged more strictly.
@LoveforChrist5 @RemnantRising1 He didn't include the [capital-D] Doctrine, say, of Nicaea there.

His triunity is important (and is in even Genesis).
THAT, the biblical witness, is crucial. Is God-breathed.
Not anything else.
@LoveforChrist5 @RemnantRising1 Not quite correct.
It is best to say one is a Christian if he or she is allegiant to the triune God. If you believe the Bible is sufficient for soteriology, any anathemas or requirements for salvation *must* come from it. Not Nicaea or anything extrabiblical.
@MrBearAtheist @TDisputations false anathematizing since shortly after Nicaea. (Sometimes in Church History this is called "the imperial corruption," the malign influence of state-controlled ecclesiology.)

I reject those false anathemas (see my Pinned Tweet).
I contend 1 Cor 4:6 is the crux of Ecclesiology.
@Nutjob90 If by doctrine you mean something like Nicaea, then you are employing a Red Herring (something I have seen many of you do).

If however you are denying that Jesus claimed to be YHWH, then you are dead wrong and patently so. I can prove it from the biblical syntax alone.
@Preston86764466 @RealBroBrandon @mpdesmond @one_not_three @OutspokenColt @thechurchsplit @JCGroves @RFPodcast3 Yet another set of lies from the one who *delights* in lies.
Patent, too. I defend as Christians people who don't speak, say, the doctrine of Nicaea as a crux of salvation.
Oneness can be saved.

People who conform to John 8:24 cannot be. Jesus's words.

I hate no human being.
@RemnantRising1 @Zazizzio @Apocalips2030 It is exactly [2 of] the Trinity - the triunity as the Bible describes it.

One of my primary vectors in my ministry is to get people to stop thinking "Nicaea" when they hear "Trinity."

Remember that "one[ness]" is right there in the word "Trinity"? "-[u]n"
@RobertGKepes @vancouverobert @michaelcoren Category error. "The Trinity" is not what was enumerated at Nicaea. It is what God enumerated in Genesis 1:1-3, the very first words of the Bible. His complex unity (impossible in Monadism) is many places in Genesis, including 16:13, 19:24, 32:30, and 48:15-16.
@RobertGKepes @vancouverobert @michaelcoren The category error is that "Trinity" is "the formulaic pronouncement of Nicaea."
https://t.co/8PK3v8ywSA
@RobertLWallJr1 @themadjw Nicaea was right that Arius was a non-Christian, but Councils can be wrong.

God-breathed John 8:24 cannot be.
@THENEST71143208 @AndrewFisherma2 YHWH is triune—that is demonstrated in Genesis.

All Christians are *allegiant* to the triune God (whatever words they employ to describe Him). One need not accord with later philosophical words, like Nicaea.

However, the Bible does explicitly anathematize people who claim
@TheApoMan @AmYisraelChai07 I guess this category error is deeply entrenched. I thought I might be able to dislodge it somewhat. Haven't made much of a dent, it seems.

Nicaea *doesn't* match Jewish trinity. Nicaea was high formula. The way God spoke it was *simple* - and might even be what you believe.
@TheApoMan @AmYisraelChai07 The phenomenon of a "Category Error" is causing the confusion. To be fair, many labor under this particular one. Nicaea did not create the Trinity, it only formulated it in particular philosophical language that became popular. The revelation was there from the beginning.
@The_Brian_Life @BayouPhilosophy @NickAllmaier For those who are interested in the truth on this matter:
Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, and Socinians are non-Christian cults, not "Christian sects."

One need not comport with Nicaea, but one cannot deny the deity of Jesus or they will "die in [their] sins" [Jn 8:23-24; 8:58].
@Trainyourmindd @Jennings4God It depends on what you mean by Trinity.
If you mean a creed, like Nicaea, then no it is not required.

If you mean what the Bible says about triunity, then there are explicit anathemas, yes.

I can say authoritatively that John 8:23-24, w/cataphora in 8:58, applies to Socinians.
@Trainyourmindd @Jennings4God So, if you are looking for exact biblical language, it is there in 8:24, for instance. One need not say the words of Nicaea, but if one denies Jesus is YHWH, the great I AM (the end of the sequential statements from 8:12 to 8:59), then "die in sins" is the corollary to Hell.
@Zazizzio @RemnantRising1 @Apocalips2030 Because 1 Cor 1-5 entails the main context of fellowshipping and disfellowshipping, 4:6 is, I contend, the crux of Christian Liberty/Unity.

So if one makes Nicaea, however correct it is, the fulcrum of anathema, one is disobeying 1 Cor 4:6. I am writing a book on this.
@chialphagirl @TravisBarrett0 @lukestamps The trouble is that people have been conditioned to think of the Greek philosophical statements at Nicaea as "The Trinity."

But God was saying it in His own way from the very beginning.
THAT is normative.
Not Nicaea.
@iancbeavis @BloodConquered The only reason it does not seem clear-cut is due to a category error:
That Nicaea defines the Trinity rather than the Bible.

But God's word is what defines theological reality, not human theology.
@islam_et_media @andrew_deford They did. In their language.
Not, mind you, in the language you demand.
And early Jews WERE 'Trinitarians'. Biblical Trinitarians. 
3 who were the 1 YHWH.
Nicaea came much later, and was not "God-breathed."

Stop peddling falsehoods. You'll be judged for it.
@jacked77 @Andie_P_S Later Christians were, you mean. 'Early' Christians were before Nicaea.

Yes, so if 2 people claim Holy Spirit, the valid methodology of Biblical Exegesis ("correctly handling the word of truth") is the only arbiter.

But so many missed this memo and think gut feeling is equal.
@jawadbalaghi Concurrent Modalism and Trinity are extremely similar.

But "Trinity" isn't what Nicaea formulated.
It just means three-who-are-one, the One YHWH.
That was present in the narrative *no later than* Genesis 16:13.
@lutheranjenkins @ifffster As do the blond Jesus devotees.
But "Go not beyond what is written" is an instruction on who to disfellowship. If it meant what you represent it as, then every person at Nicaea would be equally culpable. (They are not, and neither is the minor heterodox.)
@slim_mirokujin @OpStCyprian @Joel41681269 @CheapPhilosoph1 @BrianJHawkins @pbcmike98 @1689caveman @HwsEleutheroi "Trinity doctrine." Nicaea.
I guess if you can't prevail by honestly looking at the data, this is the next step for you.
That and nefarious accusations of motive.

Farewell.
@themadjw @Mlundquist37 @AdkinsKelsea If you disagree with the formulation of Nicaea, that is one thing.

If you say Jesus is not the great I AM, then you will "die in your sins" [John 8:23-24, 58].
@thisisMrPatriot @chuck_shanks @michaeljknowles I do not reach.
I wiped all theological presupposition at the beginning of this and was willing to follow biblical syntax wherever it led, 100%.

I contend that Nicaea is not "the Trinity." The biblical record is.
IOW, the way God says it is normative, not later philosophy.
Conciliarism, like yeast, has so infected theological discourse that the overwhelming majority of Bible-believing Christians, even ones who shout "Sola Scriptura," think the triunity of God is in Nicaea...rather than the Bible. https://t.co/vPDrOvc2xY
If I were in a tiny cult with one wing invented in 1578 and the other unanimously condemned by Nicaea, and my entire cult didn't have 1 person breathing competent in the disciplines of Biblical Exegesis, I wouldn't run my mouth off about the Bible.

That's just me.
#Unitarianism
Patently false.

People shouldn't speak outside their expertises. 😵

In a later tweet, he all but equates it with Nicaea, the same silly mistake everyone makes. Dear Lord. https://t.co/uton9vh1Vf
This interpretation of the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds goes against Scripture, and is wrong. https://t.co/HRrQoCAAo7
When it comes to knowing the triune God,
Nicaea is noteworthy but not necessary.
Scripture alone is "God-breathed" and perspicuous. https://t.co/cQmrdkr9NL

@anti_Nicene //There's many adult rp accounts around, but right now trust with age is a big issue with the lying. I see 18+ in bios and I have doubts straight away, I've become so picky with who I follow now.
@anti_Nicene //Yeah, I'm working on a two part oneshot too... that was an accident lol I will post on here when it's time, my other oneshots are on Wattpad.
@anti_Nicene //You don't have to do that, I'm going  on what I think now by checking accounts out.
@anti_Nicene You like that, yes?"

@Andrew_Micah6_8 @Meditatioyt The  why do you reject Nicaea II?
@CJCogley @JordanW41069857 the great Saint is correcting people for sloppy language. he is fully Nicene and therefore of course upholds the Monarchy of the Father.
@ClClClaudius As I demonstrate in my thread with him, after Nicaea the doctrine of the Monarchy of the Father continued until this very day unabrogated. The Trinity is not a social program.
@ContraMundum14 @lutheranlemur @MythosMayhem I am an Orthodox Trinitarian, and I uphold the Nicene Symbol of Faith that identifies the One God as the Father Almighty.
@ContraMundum14 @lutheranlemur @MythosMayhem Nyssa says the Holy Trinity is the Spirit, Son, and God. This is what Christians have always believed. It is not new. It's literally in the Nicene Creed. The Son is begotten of the Father. The Spirit proceeds from the Father. The Father is unbegotten and does not proceed.
@David_Mahfood @jedidiahatsjt @josiahwsutton @doctorchasuble @waveturtlejake @EOrthodoxy the Nicene Creed
@EBasilion I see now. I meant to say that when you read the Nicene Symbol of Fatih, the order is 1. The Father 2. The Son 3. The Spirit. So one needs to have a concept of "God" in order for "Son of God" to make sense.
@EOrthodoxy @MattMetcalf @waveturtlejake "For verily there is one God, and His word and Spirit."

Ss. John of Damascus, Nyssa, Gregory the Theologian, Basil, et al. did not fail to understand the ramifications of Nicaea.
@EOrthodoxy @MattMetcalf @waveturtlejake I am upholding Nicene Trinitarianism. I encourage everyone to read Dr. Beau Branson's dissertation or listen to his recorded lectures on this topic. From Damascene's "Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith": https://t.co/DTmNwYAIfC
@HudsonEnsz @ifffster what account of genesis?

he does not defend Arius, he's an Orthodox Christian who confesses the Nicene Creed
@JordanW41069857 @typaulmonroe @justinscoyle @thedialogist @troutsky_ @idid_not_laugh @EOrthodoxy I think Nicaea I and II are both clearer-cut. It seems that today scholars of both Chalcedonian and Non-Chalcedonian theology agree that substantively we share the same faith. The efforts of the original Neo-Chalcedonians themselves testify to the need for reconciliation, no?
@Katapetasma2 that's literally what the Nicene Creed says

"I believe in one God the Father almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth and of all things visible and invisible"
@KnoxiteTheocrat @BigNJRespector check the Nicene Creed
@MallardReborn @IanBurkePerry @OpStCyprian 3. this errant history of the councils is irrelevant to the question of Nicaea II's dogmatic declarations

4. the author himsef admits and confesses that St. John of Damascus' theology of the icon is correct.

5. the author makes basic errors in his understanding of tradition: https://t.co/mxakNLb17W
@MallardReborn @IanBurkePerry @OpStCyprian In conclusion, Rev. Ben Jefferies gave an errant and confused laundry list of vaguely connected claims. He did not demonstrate any failure of reasoning from the Fathers of Nicaea II. Honestly, reading this article was a waste of time.
@MallardReborn @IanBurkePerry @OpStCyprian christian iconography is an inherited practice from judaism. recall that ancient israel was commanded to adorn the temple with various sacred artistic depictions

nicaea ii simply elaborates the logic inherent in this tradition: kiss the Gospel book!
@MallardReborn @IanBurkePerry @OpStCyprian it's not a dunk, it's a historical fact of ancient Church archeology

Nicaea II does not authorize worshiping images, you are simply spewing bile in bad faith
@MattMetcalf @waveturtlejake @EOrthodoxy You think the Nicene Creed is beyond our understanding? Why do we insist people confess it? Aesthetics?
@MilkToastOnRye @quiet_rxnary @CJacksonBryant Western Christians have their own traditions of what they call "creeds". There is one universal Symbol of Faith, the Nicene Creed.
@MisterMoore84 highly. I just don't think Trinitarian dogma is obvious from the text alone. I think you need Apostolic tradition and especially theological innovation to make the breakthrough at Nicaea
@OlumideDare123 @ifffster so you reject the Nicene Creed?
@PastorBowman @BloodConquered that's completely false. you clearly are not familiar with traditional trinitarian doctrine, or you would know that it has always been the Nicene faith to say "I believe in one God, the Father Almighty"
@PortlyNord Bees vindicate Nicaea II. https://t.co/JRILkLUOCp
@Reesegaillard what does that mean? the biblical text does not literally teach nicene theology. is it "biblically based" because the nicene fathers quoted the bible in their arguments?
@Reesegaillard you are just prooftexting after the fact. it took the Cappadocians to invent "three hypostases in one ousia". Trinity doctrine developed thanks to their creative innovation. the earliest Christians did not read the texts you cited as meaning what was defined at Nicaea
@ReformedLad @DordtyHylemorph @HwsEleutheroi ultimately? no. they are grounded in right reason. nicene christology isnt really "in" the text
@TouchstoneJon @Hidd3nTimobo @ifffster And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead; whose Kingdom shall have no end.

—The Symbol of Faith (Nicene Creed)
@William69572973 @frjohnwhiteford No, you don't understand. Hart is *defending* Nicene orthodoxy.
@WoeToChorazin if this is true then one cannot call Christ an event unless one denies the Nicene distinction of being and person
@_JeanLannes I am an Orthodox Christian and accept the Nicene Symbol of Faith
@_JeanLannes why would they confess some local western tradition and not the Nicene Symbol of Faith upheld by the Church Universal?
@barth_bro @KarlBarthVEVO they did. as they proclaimed at the Second Œcumenical Council at Nicaea
@barth_bro no he agrees with @ostrachan and rejects Nicene orthodoxy
@choundhead @_JeanLannes i dont know what it says. i am an Orthodox Christian and uphold the Nicene Symbol of Faith
@crean_fr @VirtueApplied You don't know because you are ignorant of the Oecumenical Councils and the Holy Fathers. St. Gregory was named "Father of the Fathers" at the Seventh Oecumenical Council of the Catholic Church at Nicaea.
@emb3rz Universalism is the belief that all shall be saved. UUs are different.

The Cappadocian Fathers are an influential group of theologians who elaborated the Nicene Creed etc.

Apokatastasis is Greek for "restoring the world". It is a specific concept within universalist theology.
@flossfurman my own position on this has remained the same for the last year or so: we need a Nicea-level theological innovation on the question of anthropology
@glassphilosophy @josiahwsutton According to the Nicene Creed the One God is the Father Almighty. The Son is qualified as God of God.
@glassphilosophy @slagthompson @josiahwsutton Barth is directly contradicting St. Athanasius and represents a dramatic departure from the Nicene Faith.
@gndwyn where does the Nicene Creed use the term "one God"? to whom does it refer?
@gotteskind75 @AlbionLand1 Nicene Creed
@ioannescarr @PortlyNord The Nicene Creed is cataphatic.
@ioannescarr @PortlyNord the Nicene Creed is a positive document containing positive doctrines meant to be understood and confessed
@jacobhuneycutt_ Christianity is defined dogmatically in the Nicene Symbol of Faith, which says there is one (1) God, the Father Almighty.
@jacobhuneycutt_ If Father = God and Son = God and Spirit = God all in the same sense at the same time then the Father = Son = Spirit = God. That's not the Nicene Faith.
@jdenicholls @PaulHartyanszky @JSMilbank heresy is nothing if not a perversion of the truth. I am not a liberal, not because I reject what is good in liberalism but because I reject what is bad, because the liberal project has exhausted its meaningful historical mission. i think we need a Nicene revolution in personhood
@jedidiahatsjt @DanielJ97534935 @David_Mahfood @brent_waggoner @josiahwsutton @doctorchasuble @waveturtlejake no, I am upholding the Nicene Faith
@joe_rigney @Wedgetweets it is traditional christian theology to understand the Spirit working through time. Abraham did not believe in the Nicene Creed. How did we get from Abraham to Nicea? Hart has a coherent answer. Do you?
@josiahwsutton @doctorchasuble @waveturtlejake @David_Mahfood @EOrthodoxy 3. The Monarchy of the Father which takes the Father to be identical with the One God and the other two to be "God" in a differently qualified sense.

This last option is what is enshrined in the Nicene Creed. It is testified to also in Holy Writ and the Holy Fathers.
@lutheranjenkins I confess the Nicene Symbol of Faith. Do you want me to tweet it out line-by-line? As a heterodox you have no business questioning my Orthodoxy.
@lutheranlemur @MythosMayhem you keep equivocating

read the Nicene Creed
@lutheranlemur Christians confess in our Nicene Symbol of Faith that we believe in One God, the Father Almighty.
@matt_e_cochran I am an Orthodox Christian. I uphold the Nicene Faith. What I am trying to explain to you is the doctrine of the Trinity dogmatically declared by the Church Universal.
@matthew_w_mason @ifffster yeah that's why i think a "both and" response is helpful. affirm that Nicea did do truly novel and groundbreaking work and also that work is good
@mikeybob03 @jacobhuneycutt_ the difference is that I am an Orthodox Christian and uphold thr Nicene Creed https://t.co/5Wk0MZaHAB
@noonessleep @David_Mahfood @jedidiahatsjt @josiahwsutton @doctorchasuble @waveturtlejake there is no going "beyond" the Nicene Symbol of Faith

it can be explained, explored, etc. but never left behind or taken forward in part or lifted up and modified etc.
@ostrachan If you do not uphold the Nicene Creed, you are a false teacher.
@ostrachan Our ultimate allegiance is to the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore his Body, the Church. The Church has as its central Creed the Nicene Symbol of Faith. Beware that you do not oppose the Lord Jesus Christ.
@ostrachan This is not how the Creed relates to Scripture. The dogmas of Christology don't need "pointing to" as if the Creed is just summarizing Holy Writ, they need innovation. The Nicene council established dogma and those who do not uphold the Nicene Creed are anathema.
@phildorroll to be honest the arians were far closer to the nicene in their theology and practice than the evangelicals are to the orthodox today. it should be no surprise that there are difficulties bringing in people from such a drastically different tradition
@retsinokinitoc @jacobhuneycutt_ If you insist on this point you depart from Orthodox dogma defined at Nicaea and confirmed at every subsequent Ecumenical Council. 

Christ is God *and* perfect creation. All creation depends upon God for its very being, for as St. Paul repeats from the Greeks "In Him we move".
@retsinokinitoc @jacobhuneycutt_ The Nicene creed says he was made man.
@robertdryer Do you accept the Nicene Symbol of Faith?
@troutsky_ I think that, strictly speaking, the one God is the Father Almighty–as the Nicene Symbol of Faith states.
@typaulmonroe @JordanW41069857 @ioannescarr @sidhepleroma @justinscoyle @thedialogist @troutsky_ @idid_not_laugh @EOrthodoxy So you take "God" to mean The Trinity? Is that the only sense in which you use the term? I tend myself to default to saying "God" in the sense of the Father Almighty, as Holy Writ and the Nicene Symbol of Faith do.
@ulysses_sakr @reformedkid1517 1. Just go to a vespers service on Saturday night and talk to the priest, ditch the online discussions.

2. To be a true Church means to change. St. Paul did not confess the Nicene Creed, that theology developed over time as the Holy Spirit led the Church into all truth.
@waveturtlejake @KarlBarthVEVO @barth_bro @JoshPatch5 Christ founded, and all Nicene Christians dogmatically confess one Holy and Apostolic Church

sadly that Church has been riven with schism, and so today there are multiple particular churches claiming apostolic succession but not in full communion

we are working to resolve this
@waveturtlejake do you uphold Nicene orthodoxy?
Being simple in nature, he is Father of one only Son."

—Athanasius, "Letter on the Council of Nicaea" 11
Christianity teaches that, strictly speaking, the One God is numerically identical with the Father Almighty. As we say in the Nicene Symbol of Faith: "I believe in One God, the Father Almighty..." https://t.co/hrdcofef11
Jesus Christ is certainly ‘true God of true God,’ as the Nicene Creed puts it, but he is such as the Son of God, the God who is thus the Father. If the term ‘God’ (theos) is used of Jesus Christ, not only as a predicate, but also as a proper noun with an article,
Once a Christian truly encounters Nicene Christology—actually understanding that God became man so that man should become God—everything becomes clear.

Without that, many fall for sects preaching half-truths—or even functionally different religions.
One cannot affirm the Trinity and defend schism.

The Nicene Creed is an all-or-nothing dogmatic declaration.
Some have mocked me for upholding the patristic adiaphora that sexual reproduction is unnatural for man. St. Ambrose here clearly shows that for a Christian to claim sexual reproduction is natural contradicts Nicene christology—Christ reveals to us both human and divine nature. https://t.co/Cij4RXt874
Some try to defend Jack Spong's work from charges of heresy. Spong himself taught that "There’s no way [Jesus] can be fully human and have the Holy Spirit be his father."

This teaching brings him under apostolic anathema from Nicaea onward.

https://t.co/ODRiguQkK6
The Nicene Symbol of Faith https://t.co/D4e25wMeqz
The Nicene Symbol of Faith identifies the One God as the Father Almighty. The Word of God and the Spirit of God are not identified as the One God, but as "God of God" and as being of "one essence (ousia) with the Father". Christianity is a monotheistic religion. https://t.co/usFruat8xP
The Nicene Symbol of Faith is divinely inspired and cannot be abrogated, superseded, or sublated. https://t.co/Cbaz7YfPHn
There is no Aufhebung of the Nicene Symbol of Faith.
This is impious, diabolical theology.

And to think @DrJordanBCooper dared accuse DBH of Marcionism! Protestant brothers, please—return to Nicaea! Put away this blasphemy!

[The teacher said:] “Today we are going to explore why we say that the one God is a Trinity.” My son immediately put his hand up and said [...] “Well, I don’t know about you, sir, but I follow the Nicene Creed, which says: I believe in one God the Father.”

–Fr. John Behr https://t.co/nglTNaq9z2
you can't sola scriptura your way to Nicaea

this is why Strachan and others tend towards Christological heresy: they refuse to interpret the Church's book with the Church, and pretend they can interpret the scriptures against the Body of Christ

a basic hermeneutical error https://t.co/iTPQn1xb44
“I argue that Nicaea was not a reaffirmation of a single prior orthodoxy, but was instead an “inspired” hermeneutical sifting of wheat from chaff and a reformulation of the past in what were novel terms and concepts at the time, guided by...the final cause shaping the tradition”
“It is testament only to how slovenly McDermott’s reading of the book was that he could possibly claim it portrays Christian tradition as “bankrupt,” or claim it more or less rejects the Nicene creed. In fact, the book is a defense of tradition...”

—DBH

“When these things had been read, the holy Synod decreed that it is unlawful for any man to bring forward, or to write, or to compose a different Faith as a rival to that established by the holy Fathers assembled with the Holy Ghost in Nicaea.”

"the concept of the Trinity was invented at Nicea" https://t.co/DNjc2u36ky
"the trinity was invented at nicea" "the Trinity is originally pagan" bro stop watching conspiracy YouTubers 😂
@B_M_Phoenix If someone denies the Nicene Creed they are not a brother.
@CoachCrazy Friend essentially your entire response is false. The trinity is all over Christian writings from the end of the first century down through 300+ years before nicea
@CoachCrazy In fact, Arius views that were condemned at nicea were literally condemned by the Bishop of Rome 100 years before Nicea for not being Trinitarian, the issue at nicea was that Arius had repopularized the view and the church needed to formally address it.
@CoachCrazy The "Nicea invented the Trinity" meme is nonsense. You can find it from the first century all the way until nicea in plenty of the church fathers, and the Assyrian church tradition, the oldest tradition still around, has been trinitarian the whole time and *never* went to nicea
@Deedan_ This whole Nicea meme needs to die. 
The church fathers way before Nicea articulate exactly this. Justin Martyr articulated this, Ignatius articulated this. Persian/Assyrian tradition, the oldest one around, never went to Nicea and they have *always* been trinitarians.
@Jordanunbroken2 @RyanBea64600306 @bbathgate3510 Remember when I said you completely misrepresent me without knowing anything about me? This is what I'm talking about. 

The Nicene Creed defines christian essentials. While Catholics are heterodox and have wrong beliefs, they are still Christians in that sense.
@Jordanunbroken2 @RyanBea64600306 @bbathgate3510 The nicene creed isn't christian? 
What the heck? 

Do you even believe in the Trinity man?
@Jordanunbroken2 @ashleyxxdancer "I corrected her" says the "Nicea isn't even christian" guy. Lol.
@Jordanunbroken2 @ashleyxxdancer You're not correcting anybody if you can't get the Trinity right. Nicea was where the church fought the heresy of arianism to defend Christian orthodoxy. If you reject it as Christian, you're not a Christian, and so have no authority to tell people anything about God anyway lol
@Kit_Heyes I mean we could let y'all ask questions the issue was that this was intended as an in-house debate among Nicene orthodox Christians. It's just like it would be unfair for me to start debating different Mormon perspectives since I'm not Mormon 🤷🏾‍♂️. That wasn't intended meanly
@LukeBenji @mayaminzz name one place where the nicene creed disagrees with scripture and we can talk
@RealKyleArgyle @SteveMeisterVDM Bro the creed is the doctrine of scripture summarized lol obviously you should subscribe to nicea, you don't have the authority not to.
@RealKyleArgyle @SteveMeisterVDM You don't know what the Nicene Creed is?
@RussellTunes @Puchinpappy @NDTwinsfan . Please, for the love of God, stop spreading this easily debunkable misinformation on the internet. Do you want me to quote every single church father from 100-300 that taught it, or mention the Assyrian church never went to nicea and believed it from the START?
@SlavScottish @OleCade @CosinChristian @superxtianmario @NorthAmAnglican Nicea 2's position was an innovation in church dogma tho
@Truth_is_Truth2 @ThomasDierson Jewish rabbis were already often Binitarian, believing in 2 powers in heaven. We have PLENTY of christians 1-2 centuries who tea h Trinitarianism, and the Persian church, the oldest tradition, have been Trinitarian from the get without ever going to Nicea
@churrofreddie13 @OneGodOneChrist @Apocalips2030 @Jesniree @Preston86764466 The Trinity was taught from the first century. It wasn't "voted on". The Assyrian Christians didn't even go to Nicea and were always trinitarian. The Arian controversy, your view, was condemned for not being trinitarian in the 200s long before Nicea even happened.
@davidgreen1517 I think we can and should point to councils and creeds because the church got together around scripture and came to a conclusion. Councils are only rejected if they are clear breaks from previous tradition and have no biblical warrant (like Nicea 2, for example)
@dpatt017 @TheCynicogue It affirms the creeds, which are the essentials of Christianity. If you cannot affirm the apostles and Nicene Creed you're not a Christian, it's literally the bare minimum
@dscottplays @kkringlebotten Pope Dionysius condemned arianism in the 260s like a century before Nicea had to be convened lol. And the Persian Christians (Assyrian Churches) NEVER went to any of these councils and have been Trinitarian the whole time, and they are the oldest christian tradition
@dscottplays @lawsonharlow This is literally a lie and we've been over this. You can find trinitarianism way before Nicea in the fathers
@dscottplays There's plenty of articulations of the Trinity that are virtually the same idea as Nicea, Nicea just develops clearer language, in concept it's not changing anything
@dscottplays This is a common meme that is a lie lol you can find the Trinity in every century prior to Nicea. 

What is your view of God then?
@hadenclark_ @snemes2 Of course we is fam, Hebrews 1:3 speaks of Jesus being the exact expression of the substance of God. That's Nicene language mi boi
@i_am_masonralph "Nicea created the Trinity" is false
1. You can find the Trinity in the church fathers centuries before Nicea 
2. The Persian/Assyrian Christians, one of the oldest christian traditions (if not the oldest one around) never went to Nicea and were always Trinitarian
@jeremycain_usc @griffingulledge @CraigACarter1 The dudes are condemning or taking shots at  Nicene Creed and classical Theism, which are literally essential to historic Reformed theology, and then have the audacity to claim those who disagree are heretical.
@jhunter46 @BirminghamScot2 @aprilajoyr Nicea had nothing to do with the canon, that's a meme
@peterockstar @Ecclesiastes719 @superxtianmario Completely false. It was actually kinda common among the Jewish rabbis in the second temple period to be binitarian, affirming two powers in heaven. Trinitarianism developed from there. Persian Christians have always been Trinitarian and never went to nicea
@seekthrtruth It wasn't developed at councils. Dionysius condemned people for denying it 100 years before Nicea, Justin Martyr and many 100 before that, and the Assyrian churches never went to nicea and we're Trinitarian the whole time, and they have the oldest liturgies in the church.
@seekthrtruth No, they didn't. Read the ante-nicene fathers. Refining your language =/= creating a doctrine
@sethacles Bro Jordan is ridiculous i don't think trying to reason with him is a good idea lol. He says Nicea isn't even christian and thinks he knows everything just ignore
@tanigomzz @Tomas_Menos @Aaron63753252 Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Ignatius in the 100s. Tertullian, Origen, Irenaeus in the 200s. Many more writings too.  the Persian Christians, the oldest tradition around,were always trinitarian and never were at nicea.
@tanigomzz @Tomas_Menos @Aaron63753252 Where is this majority of scholars? Those guys affirmed a monarchy of the father view - which, spoiler alert - the Greek fathers affirmed as well (the ones at nicea). The difference is that western trinitarianism minimizes the Father's monarchy.
@waveturtlejake @henryjwallis @WB_Baskerville We don't have any example of the apostles plainly articulating the Trinity in a way like Nicea did. That doesn't mean Nicea was wrong.
BRO I CAN'T MY GUY SAYS MATURE CHRISTIANS DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO NICEA 😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Wait wait lemme get this straight - people who are otherwise reformed orthodox believers who simply want to have a discussion on race and social issues are heretics, but dudes who literally crap on the Nicene Creed are faithful orthodox brethren? 

Nah 😂😂😂😂 y'all crazy
all these common memes about christianity are hilarious

@17Wildcard @DebbieRod The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.

@ChadSmi21414284 @SpringhouseFilm That's Nicaea 2.  Nobody accepts that.
@Chas1137 @DontCallMeDebby Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.
@CherylAMadden @LakotaMan1 Wrong on facts tho.  Christ is God in every early Christian source.  Nicaea was about the homoousion.
@Chill87_ Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible...
@Chill87_ Wiki is free.  Look at the article on Nicaea.

The Da Vinci Code is fiction.
@Chris2pherinTO @Paultx890 Erm.... no.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible, and Jesus divine in every early Christian source.  I think you've been hit by the Da Vinci Code here.
@ClarenceMoxley @rdmacjn1010 @wendelltalks The concept of the Trinity is in the bible.

Nicaea had nothing to do with the trinity.  It was about the homoousion. 

These are very basic mistakes in church history.  I would recommend any basic primer on the subject.
@CleverMonsterCT @god_jhai @3secondsahead @PanAfrikan1804 Luther is 1,000 years after Nicea...
@CleverMonsterCT @god_jhai @3secondsahead @PanAfrikan1804 You: silly claim about Nicea
Me: not true
You: irrelevant claim about Luther
Me: Luther was 1,000 years later
You: changes subject

@CliveWGranville @BeatTheCult Jesus is God even in the NT, and in every early Christian text.  The wiki article merely repeats the creed of Nicaea.  Nicaea did not decide the divinity of Christ, but the homoousion. Read it again.
@CliveWGranville @BeatTheCult The Da Vinci Code isn't history, friend. It's a *novel*.  Nothing of the kind ever happened at Nicaea.

If you could share your authority to speak for Jesus or "Yahweh" or to deliver religious edicts, then we could discuss your first claim.
@ColinBr60065329 @silaen_gunawan @ShabtaiMargalit Could you explain why Nicaea?
@ComplexDigi @limolnar @booma888rv @buudgreen @SHEsus__Christ @realTuckFrumper 100% of the ancient sources say otherwise.  Be sceptical of ppl 2,000 years later assuring you otherwise.

A look at the Nicaea wiki article will tell you that it had nothing to do with the bible.
@ContraryKitten @TeseoTheBunny Such claims about "mistranslation" are always made in bad faith, tho.  Whatever you're arguing for here, that claim is bad.

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible, btw.  Google it.
@CosmicStella @Notofworks7 @iluminatibot Erm no. Look at the Wiki article on Nicaea.  This is the Da Vinci code.
@Craigthe38th @ThomasDierson @mcdonji1 @AwayFromTheKeys @RudyCerda Nah.  This is the Da Vinci code. Look at wiki on Nicaea - nothing to do with the bible.  And Jesus is God in all the Ante-Nicene Fathers, if you look.  Sorry.

@CurtisHazen @KikoKwena @HappyWife1971 @my9th_burner @DouglasKBlair I suppose when you're caught in a falsehood, start a fight.

@Den9txhhvfxdc @yaf @michaeljknowles @realDailyWire The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.
@DigiWaffles @bayou_chip @BamaSox @berryblackwater @realchrisrufo This is the Da Vinci Code, not history.  None of this is true.  The Trinity wasn't discussed at Nicaea, but the homoousion.

@DylanBrace @mykamoore @MadeToFish @WaltDisneyCo @Disney You think Christians believe the bible fell out of the sky?  Ok.

The council of Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  As your link actually says.

Do your research. Don't ignore facts because you don't like them. There's more than you think you know.

Try being more honest.
@EKripperino @totally_bill @marcado_razon @MilitantThomist He was: on his deathbed.  

Deathbed baptism was common in the 4th century. 

His successor Constantius was an Arian, but Constantine upheld the Nicene creed.  However he really didn't interfere in church affairs, unlike all his successors.
@ESTAnderson13 @RoyalHeart24 @RichardBrentar @jamesste @jonathansfrakes Erm no.  Read the Ante-Nicene Fathers.

The bible is not divinely inspired, you say?  Ok... awaiting some evidence that you're qualified to say what God does or doesn't do. 😂

@Elysan2os Nicaea did not decide that Jesus was divine.  No pope used the title of Pontifex Maximus before the renaissance.

@EricB0709 @DonaldJTrumpJr Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  The attendees knew very well that the world was round, and how big it was.  Indeed they knew more mathematics than you do, since they had to consider the date of Easter.

@EvanSchultheis @Charion1234 @julianorobertrj @arielsabar Do produce your ancient source that Nicaea decided the bible.

@FaroreReigns @FairieNamedMars @juniesanguine @NameIsFun2Say Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Google it.

The other claims are also wrong, but perhaps won't mean much until you've looked up Nicaea.
@Fernand10142353 @ThomasDierson That's not correct  - that's the Da Vinci Code, not history.  Look at wiki for Nicaea - nothing to do with the bible.  Jesus is God even in the NT and in every early Christian text.  Nicaea was about whether God the Son was equal to God the Father or similar.
@FilledIre @DarkMatter2525 If you ignore history then you end up with memes like that - malicious, stuffed full of easily fact-checked falsehoods, and indifferent to truth.

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible btw.
@FillmoreLucky @Ariel87804127 @Doticini @pinkheretic Your belief system is whatever the man on tv says it is this week.  That's why you're so ignorant about Nicaea.

@GailRic56764921 @guyschultz @lambdawon @TravelingNun Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  The decretal of the council of Rome is not genuine.  Hippo merely lists the books that can be read in church.

Nobody ever had the authority to decide, so it just drifted into uniformity.
@GarthGibbins @Holy_Pascal @GBNEWS Nah.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the content of the bible.  Look at the wiki article on the council.
@GarthGibbins @Holy_Pascal @GBNEWS True.  You just produce your peer-reviewed academic source for your claim about Nicaea, then, and we can talk.

Be better.
@GeelongCats73 @vchplz @ShayVeno @skillmasterssue @Cocoforpeace @RightWingWatch Which ancient source documents your claim that "All four canonical gospels were written anonymously and only attributed to Matthew, Mark et al in the second century"?  As far as I am aware all of them say otherwise?

Nicaea had nothing to do with the canon of the NT, surely.
@GlenGanaway @JesusIsLife_t @GodandtheBear Dear "Religions Scholar",

Could you explain how Nicaea justifies your claim?  

Scattering words like gnostic does not justify your wild but carefully vague claim.

Honesty is a choice.

Thx,
Patristic Scholar
@GoHorse18 @Phantom91 @TheBookMaven Google the bible and the council of Nicaea.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible: it was about Arianism.
@GodwinVashawn Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible canon, tho.

The apocrypha were always apocryphal, I agree.
@GodwinVashawn You: Nicaea omitted books from the bible.
Me: no they did not

Btw Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Google it, hey?  Modern myth.
@GuillermaNeblin @LisaDeason4205 @ClayTravis Nothing of the kind took place at Nicaea.

@GuzziHero @communistcorn @MJmjoum @BBCNews That may be how your religious beliefs originated, but Nicea was nothing like that.  Wiki is free, you know.
@GuzziHero @communistcorn @MJmjoum @BBCNews You're mistaken about Nicea, but your previous claims were the Zeitgeist hoax.  Your last sentence suggests you believe low-iq atheist claims.  Educate yourself.
@GypsyPirate58 @RebekahDuffus @DarqKarma @_Zombie_Crew_ Fair enough.  I'm a history enthusiast doing my bit to keep the weeds down online.  There are quite a few modern myths, and nobody needs the raw facts wrong, or so I think.  A few of us do this.  Nicaea is one of my targets.  🙂
@GypsyPirate58 @RebekahDuffus @DarqKarma @_Zombie_Crew_ I was responding to a claim about history.  So... it's something that can be looked up.  Amusingly the author blocked me rather than discuss it, so I attach a screengrab.

@HaseebMoheb @lifescientist01 Wrong on facts.  Nicaea was about the homoousion, not the Trinity.  Every early Christian source calls Jesus God.  It's 600 years before some Arab pretends otherwise.

@HedyLamarr0629 @RachelBitecofer Nah.  Look at the wiki page for the council.  None of this is true.  It's from the Da Vinci Code.

Nicaea was about whether God the Son was equal to God the Father or not; and the date of Easter.  Nothing else.
@HellBoundReaper @EricaFBoehm @LifeNewsToo Nah.  This is really bad. Google Tertullian. 

Jesus is God in all the Ante-Nicene Fathers.  They're online in English so it's easy enough to check.  Heretics in that period tended to question if he was really human.  Different times.
@HeresyUntapped @KimCanavan5 @geostylegeo You think the NT documents were written after Nicaea?  Ok.

Those who knew him thought otherwise.

Possibly think before replying.
@HertzogTina @brx013 @NoLeaksInTheFam @MauraWakefield @MattWalshBlog But first, you need to learn something about this.  You know nothing about this but hearsay.  Nicaea indeed.

@HolcombeK11 @mikeyB2025 Quite right about google, but I offered it as an easy option.

Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrowly focused, on the date of Easter and the homoousion. (Don't ask 😂)

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

Christianity did not become the state religion until Theodosius, 50 years later.
@IandroidL @geostylegeo The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.

@Indigo17_ @TaylorRMarshall Nah.  Look up Nicaea in wiki.  Nothing to do with the bible.
@InfinitiveZ @mercherolvaag Hippo and Carthage did not "pick the books", as you can see if you look at their Acts.  Nicaea wasn't about the Trinity, but the homoousion. It did harmonise the date of Easter.

Bad history there, I'm afraid.
@IoannisIoannou9 @mehmetao It did.  But unless we think that before Nicaea nobody believed in God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, etc, then this doesn't justify the claim made, surely.

No idea what the context of this is, but you goofed badly here.
@JensLilCorner @chilijellybeans Nah.  Google Tertullian, ca.217. The formula just summarises what the NT says.  Nicaea was about something very technical, the homoousion.
@Jensum2 @stock_janine @exodus21_7 @jeremynewberger Google Nicaea and the bible.

No idea what the rest of that has to do with anything.  NB the Ethiopian church doesn't really have a canon.
@Jensum2 @stock_janine @exodus21_7 @jeremynewberger Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  The bible grew, not shrank.

Could you explain just what point you are insinuating here?  Something about God not inspiring books hand-copied?  Or copied only by non-whites, or some other identity group?

It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.
@JonLawr45183174 @SaraCatling @OliviasAuntieCA @Mikethewander1 @JustnBullington Although Nicaea actually had nothing to do with the bible. Wiki has a page on the council.
@JulieParker144 Nicaea did not "declare the divinity of the Son".  The Son is God in every early Christian source.  It declared that God the Son was of the same substance as God the Father.
@KR3Wmatic Nicaea wasn't about the Trinity - everyone at Nicaea believed in the Trinity - but the homoousion.  Any history of dogma will give you this, and more.
@KStep1805 @SimonReye @SubbingKitten @befaithful10 @newvangelicals Wiki is free.  Look up Nicaea.  Nothing to do with the bible.

I expect you just live by whatever the man on tv says this week, like most people, so you're in a weak position here, you know.

@KyleCopeGoliath @rembuchelover @AtheistsL Nicaea had nothing to do with Xmas.  Really sorry!  Xmas just appears in 336 in a church calendar in Rome.  No ancient source records why.
@LSpaduzzi @AndyB213 @joslater37 @Logically_JC If you look at the wiki article on Nicaea, you'll find that this is a myth.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

What's this "bunch of men" stuff?  You was expecting lizard people?
@LaceReto1 @TrulyNorthern Nicea had nothing to do with the bible. Google it.

@LeperPolitical @Freedom9369 The Coptic gospel of Thomas - there are other "gospels of Thomas" is a fake.  The apocrypha are, um, apocryphal. 😊 (Well, I think I'm witty...)

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible btw.
@LhWolfgl Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible...?

The apocryphal gospels are, well, apocryphal! 😊

Possibly you're seeing how much modern atheism derives from fringe protestantism?
@LighterWay2Live Think for yourself; and don't idly repeat daft conspiracy claims about Nicaea.
@LindaAnsley1 @pirateconductor @InfiDale3476 @stassfurth @CindySu31272135 @catoposey @GarrettForMI Erm... in what respect is Nicaea "eye-opening"?
@LittleRaven_1 @AztecKing12 @1markshumway @MayraFlores2022 Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Men decided every single belief of your own, yet you don't know who they are.

@Mark_UK73 @JayneKimlee @Patrick63117986 @SeidlerThomas @AiG You might wish to ask some Christians before repeating these idle claims.  As it is, it seems that you have something to hide.

Which decision at Nicaea do yiu refer to?
@MarketeerMa @Sockraytes @watchitbrrrn Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible tho.

The apocrypha are, um, apocryphal. 😁
@MartinMaola @SeptembersRain No books were rejected at Nicaea
@MartinMarten432 Nicaea was something rather different to this old conspiracy theory, tho.  Very narrowly focused on the date of Easter and Arianism.
@Mary_is_Queen @blackdragon7771 @CatholicMcGee @writriverdale Probably Hosius of Cordoba.

Constantine didn't call the council.  It was already assembling at Ankara when Hosius persuaded Constantine to pay the bills so western bishops could attend.  The emperor liked the idea.  Venue switched to Nicaea so he could attend too.
@Matt24695841 @tomdelonge Nicaea didn't assemble any bibles.  Google it.

@Melalexander1 @KathleenHooks9 @parrapoep @RubrumVinum @LakotaMan1 You think the NT was written in 230 AD?  That Nicaea had something to do with the bible?

Christianity can only be opposed by crude falsehoods. Apparently. Maybe it's true.

@Milfblocked @TheSkeptic4122 He could look at wiki for Nicaea...
@Miniphany7 @FrankHadzalic @ProfotaAva @lizsteel199 This is a bit awkward, I know, but I have to ask if you've ever researched the Council of Nicaea, for it had nothing whatever to do with deciding the contents of the bible.

Are you perhaps advocating for living by whatever the man on tv says this week? Which is what most ppl do?
@MissUkpai @DustinBenge Mate, all these claims are false.  Look at the wiki article on Nicaea.
@MoistureVapor8r @unifiedprolife Nah. This is the Da Vinci Code, not history.  Nicaea wasn't about that.  It was originally an accident and narrowly focused on the date of Easter and the homoousion
@MorgainePen1 @isletheologian Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Take a look at the wiki article on Nicaea.  Nothing to do with any of this.

@MrHurst16 @TYGRRRREXPRESS Wrong about Nicaea.

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible anyway.
@MythosMayhem @SuperTRev166 @drbennett81 @InfinitelyManic @JoeE99398230 @ScottAniol The KJV translation is conservative: the translators were instructed not to frig about with it.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

@NastyWoman303 @Lademogirl2015 @KathyVarzino Google the council of Nicaea yourself.  Learn.  It had nothing to do with the bible.

You claim the bible is not divinely inspired. That's a statement about God.  Care to share your divine revelation endorsing your authority to speak for God?

Be better.
@NateoftheNorth @Hedzer15 @DavidKayumba11 @phantomhitch @AAgather Wrong about Nicaea.

Weird claim about the crusades.
@NathanTheGr8an @CovenantLegacy @ostrachan I don't know of any ancient source that would agree with that comment.

If you mean "The Nicene creed is older than the closure of the canon of the NT" then this is true - if we ignore Constantinople - but it doesn't mean anything.
@Nnamdichikee @Ada_Ugom Could you explain the connection?  Few know about Nicaea, but I do, and I don't know what point you think you're making.

@Rural_Alkebulan @Stonendlovu There are 5000 pages of early Christian literature prior to Nicaea.  Presumably you think Nicaea could time travel?

Educate yourself.
@S_Schneider16 @ThomasDierson @D3m3nt1ng Nicaea had no such purpose.  The rest of your argument is like saying Nicaea is responsible for Vatican 2.  

Nicaea had nothing whatsoever to do with the canon of the NT
@SaSutek @screwoff69420 @AtheistIntelli2 Nah.  This is the Da Vinci Code.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible, which didn't settle down for another 40 years.

@SamuraiElf @kinspire2 Nah.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the canon. Have a google.

@SojiZolisa @musareed @AdvoBarryRoux Child, you lied.  And you're "replying" with more lies.

"Jesus was copied from the Roman god Mithras.The divinity of Jesus was decided at the council of Nicea"

Start there.  Prove it, or apologise.
@SoundsOfNyx @HeroicChurch @BillyPilgrim41 @SipkeStorm @Gluctose1 @WendyRogersAZ Weird objection.  If your case - whatever it is - relies on finding excuses to ignore historical data, then basically you've lost the argument, surely.

That's a false description of Nicaea btw.
@Space10116 @cryptoinvestorJ @xDredUK Nah.  Nicaea is the only council most people have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy claims.  But it was originally an accident, and very narrow: it harmonised the date of Easter and decided the homoousion (don't ask!).  That was it.

In our age anyway, it must be moot.

Better recheck your god.
@Staned_Up @TomCottonAR It didn't happen at all.  Nicaea is the only council most ppl havd heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories. But it was actually an accident, and very narrow.  It harmonised the date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion (don't ask! 😂)  That's it.
@Staned_Up @TomCottonAR This is bad history.  None of this ever happened at Nicaea.
@Stealth702__ @ThomasDierson @ArmlessKittyfox @JerryHammond68 @Leslieoo7 @DeathMetalV Could you produce the ancient text documenting your claim about Nicaea?  It isn't true, and you offer no evidence for it.

@Straticus2 @HeroinHatesYou The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.
@TAFKAB2 @StellarRevolts @wendelltalks Wiki is free.  Look up the article on Nicaea. Nothing to do with the bible.

Be less gullible towards internet hearsay.
@TAFKAB2 @StellarRevolts @wendelltalks You think Nicaea had something to do with the bible?  Ok.
@TAKJK5 @matrix_escapee @laurabusse @q_slavic I do know about Nicea.  But I fear you do not...
@TOmbadilly @NarratingFools @boboosta @joncoopertweets Nah.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Look at the wiki article for Nicaea.
@T_Perez_Ross @FrBarnabas @EWErickson Nah.  The formulation took time, but Jesus is God and man even in the NT. Nicaea was about God the Son, not Jesus.

Not sure what you're pushing here, but you have the history wrong.
@TalcumXXL @PlantLiberty Nah.  This is bunk.  Find me even one Christian writer before 325 who says so.  Truly, they all affirm his divinity.

Nicaea had nothing whatever to do with this.
@TalesofAeolux @corr3ctions @mehCloudy @JakeSucky You think Nicaea decided the bible?  Oh dear...
@TalksWise @Machaon28636205 @amlivemon You think the gospels are anonymous?  Read the heading... 🙄

The NT apocrypha are... apocryphal. They were never part of the bible.

Nobody ever selected gospels. 

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.
@Tamchanted @freckled_frack Well evidently the professor was very ignorant, as Nicea was about the homoousion; Constantine did not intervene in church dogma, unlike all his successors; and Jesus is God in every early Christian source.

@TeraHive @MikeErn90163503 @JoJoFromJerz You are mistaken.  Everyone at Nicaea was Trinitarian.
@Terryboxing @GmanInfamous @BoxingFanatic_ @jackcr0c1 The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.
@TexasMoran @TobyLogsdon Nor did Nicaea define the Trinity - it was about the homoousion.  It was Tertullian who coined the formula, who said, "the church is not a conclave of bishops but the spiritual assembly of spiritual men."
@TexasMoran @TrevorSheatz Eastern Orthodox were at Nicaea - using time machines - but no bible-believing Christians?  Interesting.
@TheSkepticalHe1 @PardonMoiFr3nch The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow.

@TomPadfoot @WhiteN0rth @pr0fiteer @mattnightingale Look at Wiki on Nicaea.  Nothing to do with the bible. 

Nothing to do with the divinity of Jesus either, which is in every early Christian text.

Maybe ask yourself why these falsehoods are circulated?
@TopherMcLeod @jorgensen_jaxon @Yourmom84153135 @JakeBequette91 @Annakhait How can you be CERTAIN that any ancient text has not been tampered with?

How is it that you are CERTAIN (but wrong) about Nicaea?
@ToryRebuttal @krinjewolker Nicaea did not discuss the contents of the bible tho.

@XYZXYZsauce @KarlKvng @TheOlutosin @SnoopSleekSaga @mccovey_willie @kvngayooo Not true that, but a modern conspiracy theory.  Nicaea was about other things.

@Yambarudan @JacksonLahmeyer Humanity has even more beliefs than that.  I take it you think all but yours are wrong. 😂

Maybe learn about Nicaea before revealing your ignorance.
@YeshuaSavess @Wiseskay7 @fahs35540196 @UTDprotuz @HassanRai32 @muslimdaily_ Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible anyway, as even the wiki article acknowledges.

The gnostic texts were never part of the bible.  Composing apocrypha goes on even today.
@YoUDeeMac @JgRestore @ChellBelle39 @ToddKBailey @kylegriffin1 Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

@YoboYoGobo @GabrielMares703 @smashbaals Because that wasn't what Nicaea was about
@Zuibee These claims about Nicaea are also false.  No contemporary source records this, and the impression rather is that Constantine had no fixed views.
@_Krimsen_King @Defetyone Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.
@_earlyworm @gimhamflower @christianamillr Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Google it - modern myth.  Nobody ever "designed the canon" - it grew gradually.
@_oz_zie_ @Loud_Intrvrt @ogheneyxle @Barthiwu No discussion took place at Nicaea about putting Easter on a solar date.  It was entirely about the calculation of passover.  

Nobody knows what the solar date actually was.
@ajsteelshow @Darthjimscott41 @catolicamaven Nah, that's the Da Vinci Code.  Take a look at the wiki article on Nicaea - rejects that claim about the bible.
@alajtovic @Cernovich Nah.  Just google Nicaea and the bible.  Truly.  It's even in the wiki article.  

This one is just a modern myth.  Beware.
@alajtovic @Cernovich Nothing; so they never did.  Nicea did not do this.
@ally_oneill @gwstewart76 @RepSwalwell A couple of small points: leaving aside your racism, Nicaea was composed of brown people, it had nothing to do with either claim.

@anonymousmoood @OgbeniDemola Wiki is free.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.
@apearlma @litprof2 @JamesSurowiecki Nah.  This is conspiracy stuff.  Nicaea was very narrow and settled the homoousion and the date of Easter.  That's it.  Constantine had no view on either.
@artandmasterpi1 Oh Nicaea was it?
@b_brown5153 @Christ_Hitman @LukcianoR @opsydee7 @kvngayooo I do know about Nicaea; unlike yourself, it seems, for no such events took place at Nicaea.  Google it.

I do know the criterion for inclusion in the NT. I doubt that you do.
@b_brown5153 @Christ_Hitman @LukcianoR @opsydee7 @kvngayooo This seems to be further random claims.  

The NT apocrypha are, um, apocryphal.  They were never part of the bible.  The bible grew, not shrank.  Nothing to do with Nicaea.
@ballp36 @stevejco Nah, that's the Da Vinci Code.  Nothing of the sort happened at Nicaea.

The apocryphal gospels are, well, apocryphal. Later fakes.  People still create such things even today.

@be_happyto @endtimeslife Interesting. You might wish to google Tertullian. Nicaea was about the homoousion, not the Trinity.

Probably best to be less belligerent about a subject on which you clearly know nothing.

@bilalthearab @matthewbarjonah @anselm_turmeda Nah.  Nicaea wasn't about the Trinity, but about whether God the Son was equal to God the Father, or similar to him.
@bitcoinholder @Italian347 They are both Nicea.
@blu57nav @SuperTRev166 @Renevelation Nah.  That's the Da Vinci Code, not history.  Look at wiki on Nicaea.
@bobotea999 @TTwelvers @KerrDepression No, that's fake.  No such group existed, and certainly not at Nicaea.
@bobotea999 @TTwelvers @KerrDepression Oh.  So... not at Nicaea.  An Arab heretical movement, only known from 50 years later.  Not called Mariamites but Collyridians.  

I'm not sure that leaves much of your claim, but ok.
@bobotea999 @TTwelvers @KerrDepression Ok. So the claim is about *Islamic* beliefs about what Christians believed.  That might well include heretical groups and all sorts of oddbods, or be fiction.  The Nicaea claim is garbage, but it's possible that the Muslim claim might relate to these Collyridians.
@bobotea999 @TTwelvers @KerrDepression Unless you can produce some evidence for your claim that "Mariamites" were present at Nicaea, you need to apologise for posting a falsehood. 😁
@bobwade71 @Isho_Od @renckles Could you produce your ancient source for your claim that "first century Christians didn't believe in the Trinity"?  Also for your claim that the doctrine was "finalised" at Nicaea?
@bookofkatherine Athanasius - 367 AD

Always amusing to here people complain about translations.

Also about mythical "editing".  Their problem is that it *isn't* edited, so doesn't suit them.
@chanteur_sagi @NoLieWithBTC @RonFilipkowski But Tertullian says that he is merely repeating what was taught from the beginning.  Nicaea is about the homoousion, not the Trinity.
@chanteur_sagi @iamAtheistGirl Before Nicaea 100% of Christians believed he was God.  You've been hit by the Da Vinci Code here.  None of that is correct.  Nestorius didn't think that, btw, and wasn't born for another century.  Nobody was persecuted after Nicaea either.
@chariot_iron @AnthonyManechia @Biased_Lemmings @DazzDzatron @muir2021 @LiveDie4Jesus Which "gospels" precisely depict Jesus as only a man?  Mostly the apocrypha deny his humanity. 

Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

NT mss are 2nd century on.

This is basic history, you know?
@charles05543559 @ryn_h_ Read the original language.

Nicaea did nothing of the sort.
@chrismdowd @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner Nobody decided what's in the bible, unlike the Koran.  Take a look at wiki on Nicaea - nothing to do with the bible.
@chrismdowd @ThomasDierson @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner Do produce your Ante-Nicene evidence of Christians who rejected the Trinity.

Do produce your primary source saying Nicaea was about the Trinity.

@chrismdowd @ThomasDierson @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner The Trinity is unknown before Nicaea?
@chrismdowd @ThomasDierson @Jcrane2006 @TrumpsFeetHurt @WarnerismyHERO @Caitlyn_Jenner Wiki is free.  Look up the council of Nicaea.  Nothing to do with the bible.  Nor with the Trinity.
@chrizyboyzi @PenTitan Nicaea said that, for calculation purposes, the equinox was 21 March.  But the Julian calendar is defective. 21 March on the Julian calendar isn't near the equinox any more.  So the Gregorian calendar was created. The eastern rite still use the Julian calendar tho.
@claybropilFL @anglo_xian If you think Nicaea II was from the religion the apostles preached then you need medical help.
@cristalack @PrivateerTrucks @hawiaancovefe @RegressiveBard I'd prefer to say that the medieval Catholic church arises in the late 4th century, following 50 years of development after Nicaea, and the arrival of canon law.
@cupperty @TheBlackCat02 Nah.  This is the Da Vinci Code, not history.  Look at the wiki article on Nicaea - nothing to do with the bible.
@d_walters237 @MorbidlyAhBeast @jayaf1980 @RightWingWatch Historically proven... no.  Not even a mainstream theory.

Wrong about Nicaea, and, unlike Nicaea, you are racist.
@danthestep @MGouffet @Original_CTV As soon as someone randomly name-drops Nicaea, we may generally be confident that they know no church history and are trying to bluster.
@danthestep @MGouffet @Original_CTV Unfortunately for you, I know much more about church history than you do.  In particular, unlike yourself, I have read every ancient source about Nicaea.  Amusing falsehood tho.

I notice that you ignored my point, and instead started trolling.

Be better.

@dona17_mc @Ojeda4America This last bit isn't true.  It's a projection of modern ideas.  But in antiquity everyone thought Jesus was divine; they just weren't sure he was truly human.  He is God in the NT and all the early Christian writers.  Nicaea was about the homoousion (don't ask 😂).
@eddmuhammad @rulaguerrero No, no - Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

@elektrikhippie @ThomasDierson @seekthrtruth @JeBroo5 @sygarte Could you produce any ancient source saying that "the doctrine wasn't established until the Council of Nicaea".  It's nonsense, I'm afraid.

Tertullian says otherwise to your last point. Since he lived around 200 AD, I think we may take his word for it.
@empathysays Wiki is free.  Look up Nicaea.  Nothing to do with the bible.
@eniskuseh @ferrismattic Are you asserting that the passage is not referenced in any papyrus or ante-Nicene source?  On what basis?
@eniskuseh @ferrismattic Google direct and indirect witnesses to a text.  Nobody is making any statement about the reliability of the opinions of anybody.  We're just seeing who quotes what at what date.  

I'm awaiting your evidence for a post-Nicene date for that chapter, by the way.  :-)
@eniskuseh @ferrismattic I notice you did not reply to my query:

Are you asserting that the passage (above, Acts) is not referenced in any papyrus or ante-Nicene source?  On what basis?
@enoorth Um... the period after Nicaea, from about 474 on, WAS the Dark Ages, at least in the West.  It was a period of misery and superstition.  Educated Greek bishops from the East used to tear their hair out at it.
@ernestgbadago There were Tridentine Catholics at Nicaea? 😂

@evan__fowler @postmodpen @livetogro @transcendyou @beledbylove Nicaea was an accidental council, conspiracy theories notwithstanding.  It was very narrow.  It harmonised the date of Easter, and, in response to the Arian heresy, it agreed the homoousion (you don't want to know!)  Prosaic stuff.
@evangelicalpleb @scecere2355 @ihavemyteeth69 @FoundersMin I agree.  I think this is a hearsay version of some US religious studies stuff where they call all the heresies Christians and then claim that this proves that Christians endorsed all the stuff they actually rejected.  Games with words.

Nothing to do with Nicaea tho.
@exC_Esther Nah.  Google Tertullian. 

Everyone at Nicaea was Trinitarian. The basic idea is in the NT.
@ferrismattic @eniskuseh I've certainly seen the claim made, in various forms.  It would be interesting to know the origin of it.  I think it's undoubtedly true, at least as stated, but I've seen some fairly extreme versions which would not be correct for the Ante-Nicene Fathers, at any rate.
@ferrismattic @eniskuseh In fact various verses from Acts 20 are referred to by Origen, Polycarp, Methodius of Olympus, and in the Acts of Paul.

I did find no reference for an ante-nicene papyrus.  But taking all this together, that tweet looks like a fact carefully selected to deceive.  Faugh.
@ferrismattic @eniskuseh Notice how his tweets combine genuine facts artfully arranged to make them misleading or sound dangerous.  Notice how he didn't reply to my query about what his evidence was that Acts whatever-it-was is post-Nicene.  Note the evasiveness.

This is not accidental, I'm sure.
@fisherman_angry @ThomasDierson @marcado_razon @VingeRenGaoma @ThinkingAtheist If you look at wiki for Nicaea, you'll find it had nothing to do with the bible.

No such reasoning appears in any ancient document describing Nicaea.

@frankjcjohn @Isaac477274 @izusatsou This seems to be a strawman.  Nobody thinks that this is what happened at Nicaea, no ancient source treats the homoousion as "creating Jesus as god", and this misrepresents how the councils work.
@frankjcjohn @Isaac477274 @izusatsou You address a researcher specialising in early Christian history, and especially Nicaea.  Should you feel able to respond properly to my point, then we can talk.  

Hearsay is not a reliable guide to Christian history.
@freedomring2022 @metal_prophecy @SilentGarrett @AnthonySabatini It's all very well to throw irrelevant bafflegab around, if not very honest, but you *do* need to get your facts right in case an expert wanders by.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

I have no idea how you got yourself into this claim, but it's really really daft.
@laurabusse @TAKJK5 @matrix_escapee @q_slavic ... if Constantine would pay the travel bills then western bishops could attend and they could have a world council.  Constantine agreed.  The venue was switched to Nicaea so the emperor could attend.
@laurabusse @TAKJK5 @matrix_escapee @q_slavic It seems to be useful even today.  Of course back then I didn't actually *know* what Nicaea said.  But I knew how to find out! :-)
@laurabusse @TAKJK5 @matrix_escapee @q_slavic Long ago I compiled all the primary sources for Nicaea here.  Not too many.

https://t.co/uLI5V14Nwd
@laurabusse @TAKJK5 @matrix_escapee @q_slavic Nicaea was actually an accident.  A priest in Alexandria called Arius was preaching that, while God was a Trinity, He had not always been a Trinity, and "there was a time when the Son was not".  His bishop told him to stop.  But the idea had spread.
@laurabusse @TAKJK5 @matrix_escapee @q_slavic The 1st council of Nicaea is the only council most ppl have heard of, so it attracts conspiracy theories.  But it was really very narrow. It harmonised date of Easter, and agreed the homoousion ( don't ask! 😂). It did not decide the bible.  Nor did it make Jesus God, etc.
@leegaalam @MsKlugClass @sdheiny2 @Amygirl55 @JayandRagsy @LakotaMan1 Do produce your ancient source documenting your claim that John did not write the book.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible, btw, as most people know.
@lindacaplinger @BronwynJI @sc_rasmussen @LakotaMan1 If you look at that link, it will tell you that Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.

The text of the bible has not been altered like that.  Such claims are usually made in bad faith, so beware.  The bible doesnt, of course, address political programs invented centuries later
@lion_4_zion @BlackPopeVice @FiercelyMeRN @EdwardRose5 Could you explain your claim about Nicaea?

Education is important.
@litprof2 @apearlma @JamesSurowiecki Child, you are trying to pass off your ignorance on an expert on Nicaea.  

Your ignorant comments make clear that your last claim is a lie.

If you can only defend your beliefs in this foul way, maybe just go back to confession?  Have some self-respect.

@loud_test @MariahScientist Um... what was your claim here about Nicaea?
@ltdumbear @WLife100 @TimesofIsrael Um... no... that's the Da Vinci Code.  Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible, and those at the council were all native Greek speakers anyway.
@lysiosforever @schoolorprison @RoyCastaneda11 @queenie4rmnola Nah.  This is bad history, mixed with bad theology.  Who told you this?

None of this happened at Nicaea.

As for your theological claim, did you really think Christians and Jews think the bible fell from heaven?
@lysiosforever @schoolorprison @RoyCastaneda11 @queenie4rmnola Wiki is free.  Go and lookup Nicaea.

@madmadworld68 @Tim13579242 @HeatherRose24 @mean_toe @LiveDie4Jesus Nah. Look at wiki on Nicaea.  Nothing to do with the bible.  Indeed nobody ever voted on the bible.
@maggiesmom1_mom @Dr_Fate73 @jonnyd415 @laurenboebert Surely this is the Da Vinci Code?  Which is, erm, fiction.

None of these claims about Nicaea are true, as a minute or two of googling would reveal.

So maybe your parents need to apologise to the priest?
@margay77 Nicaea was in 325, but it had nothing to do with the bible.  The bible was finalised gradually, at no one point, but the process was certainly complete by 400 AD.

@robblock56 @taradublinrocks @Logically_JC You've picked up some fake history there.  Jesus is divine in the NT and in all the 5,000 pages of the Ante-Nicene Fathers. Nicaea was about the homoousion.

Theological claim that the bible writers were not divinely inspired. Are you sure you're qualified to speak for God? 😂

@schizoshakya @AionOf Not really.

Easter is the Sunday after passover, when Christ was executed.  Passover is the first full moon after the equinox.  Plus a million footnotes.  Nicaea decided that they wouldn't use the Jewish calculation for passover (which was cocking up) but do their own.

@tl_trevaskis @JedWhite13 @darafaye Fun fact: people assert the most ignorant nonsense about Christian history.

Silly claims about Nicaea, there, which did not discuss whether "Jesus was God" (!) but the homoousion.  Jesus is God even in the NT, and in every early Christian text.

@tristanaad @KenKyrios @Issaknoahz @Beardisimo @mohammed_hijab @didierdrogba Jesus is God even in the NT.  Every early Christian text from the first calls him God.  Look in the Ante-Nicene Fathers.

@uchecy @Dimutodimu @nwoke_nanka @wisdom4tyn @LordLuggaed @TunjiKolawole01 @Wizarab10 What a dishonest reply.

The best knowledge you will have is the one you teach yourself. For a start, google Eusebius also known as Saint Jerome. Study the outcome of the council of nicea and the council of hippo. Educate yourself. And apologise.
@ultrawaved @destiny_d1_ You think Nicaea compiled the bible?

I agree, when a book is edited by a man then it shows that it is man made.  Uthman says hi.

Looking forward to your proof that Uthman's book is "the direct word of god".

@watamelon23 @IW_Truelight @MaxF8294 @NotENVYENT17Y56 That claim about the council of Rome relies on a document that isn't actually genuine. 

If you think the NT didn't exist before 382, then the Ante-Nicene Fathers would like a word.
@wendykayeauthor @habitualhealth Nicaea had nothing to do with the bible.  Just google and see.  In fact nobody ever "chose".  Everything from the apostolic circle was included, and everything that claimed to be that wasn't obviously lying.
@whatep @BeatTheCult Jesus is God even in the NT, and he is called God in every early Christian source.  Nicaea was about whether God the Son was of the same substance as God the Father or not.  Nobody benefits from getting the raw data wrong, I agree, whatever our religion.
@wodmarach @SheilaBarnhart6 @KurtRexCooper @pludger @cmaum Which Christians prior to Nicaea did not think he was God?

Sorry but this is just wrong.  Every early Christian writer affirms this.

No books were ever "removed" from the bible - it grew.
@writer2023 @BomberofNY @Cobratate Jesus is God even in the NT, and in every one of the 5,000 pages of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.

@1111Zion1111 The term “Trinity” was in circulation for decades before the Council of Nicaea. 

An apologetic work by Theophilus of Antioch around AD 189 (see below) contains the first recorded use of the term (for reference, Nicaea was held in AD 325). https://t.co/ycVR4gy9Mk
@6079SmithWinsom @orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 It means that they don’t deny the Son’s involvement in the spiration of the Spirit.

That argument doesn’t hold up because omissions do not mean unbelief. Nicaea didn’t have a different faith than Constantinople because Nicaea omitted some text.
@6079SmithWinsom @orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 Not what I'm saying. Do you think the original Nicene Creed "got it wrong" when they left out the Spirit's procession from the Father in AD 325?
@6079SmithWinsom @orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 The Nicene Creed doesn't deny the theological truth the Filioque communicates.
@BloodnVinegar @orthodoxanglicn Nicaea had like five western bishops, equal East/West representation has never been the requisite for ecumenical status.
@Dodgson_X @amandajo____ Cite a single primary source that Constantine forced the Church to accept the traditional biblical canon at Nicaea.
@DourVisage @iamschuyler97 @matthewpao1 @orthodox_luke Also, just for clarity, Trullo was held in Constantinople from AD 691-692.

To put that in perspective, Nicaea was closer in date to the crucifixion of our Lord than it was to Trullo.
@DourVisage @iamschuyler97 @matthewpao1 @orthodox_luke The speed of information has nothing to with it. Nicaea was received throughout the Mediterranean in the span of several years. Everyone knew about it.

Plus, Trullo doesn’t speak of Arians in ignorance. It simply speaks of Arians not needing rebaptism (because theirs were valid)
@Huck1112 @jacelala But this assertion doesn’t make sense. Constantine mediated disputes for religious groups within the Empire. That was a responsibility as sovereign.

Plus, if he wanted a sameness of belief, why didn’t he enforce the creed and instead allow Arianism to run rampant after Nicaea?
@Huck1112 @jacelala Furthermore, I don’t claim to be a historical resource on Roman military history, but there seemed to have been a peace settlement between the two powers during the time of Nicaea. https://t.co/YFw9REyvZV
@Huck1112 @jacelala I also don’t know what you mean when you say the Eastern Church fought against Trinitarianism. The vast majority of the hundreds of bishops who attended Nicaea were Eastern. There were only like six Western bishops in attendance.
@Huck1112 @jacelala I don’t mean to come off as rude but you really need to do more research. What you’re saying is just utterly ahistorical.

Even if you’re referring to the Oriental Orthodox they accepted Nicaea.
@Huck1112 @jacelala I just don’t see how. The Eastern Church was not excluded and Nicaea has nothing to do with why the “Orthodox branch” exists or schismed.
@Huck1112 @jacelala I think what happened was you may have read something on the Council of Florence (because there was also a Byzantine Emperor named Constantine in attendance who was hoping for support from the West against Muslim aggression) and misapplied it to Nicaea.
@Huck1112 @jacelala There was a mass flourishing of Arianism in the East that’s recorded by Jerome after Nicaea, but the Emperors supported this “Arian frenzy” until Theodosius.
@Huck1112 @jacelala This is also the case for Ephesus, Chalcedon, Second Constantinople, Third Constantinople, and Second Nicaea all followed First Constantinople and affirmed the Creed, even though they were all held in the East.
@Huck1112 @jacelala Yes, it’s the council that followed Nicaea. They affirmed the Nicene Creed and revised it to further articulate doctrinal Trinitarianism. 

I’m bringing it up since there wasn’t this totalistic Eastern opposition to Nicene Christianity like you say.
@Huck1112 @jacelala You’re getting a lot of information incorrect. Nicaea was held in AD 325. Islam hadn’t been founded until AD 610.
@Irrelevant786 @KoIyaE_ @xavierjp__ @TheSyedHaq That's not what we're saying either. Christ was really begotten. The Son was caused to be. However, this term begotten is used in a context unlike the usual definition (Nicaea captures this with "begotten not made"). Hence the term "Son" is metaphorical, but the begetting is not.
@OrthodoxReflec1 @SnorkytheOrca What about the Miaphysites who rejected the Council of Chalcedon? Or the Arian laity that flourished in the East after Nicaea?

At what point does the reception of the laity become negligible?
@PhillipMcCabe5 @6gwatermelon I truly don’t want to misunderstand your position, but are you implying the Council Fathers of the Councils of Nicaea and Constantinople were heretics?
@PhillipMcCabe5 @6gwatermelon The reason I ask is because even Nicaea uses terminology and concepts coined by Aristotle in order to articulate the doctrine of the Trinity.
@PhillipMcCabe5 @6gwatermelon True, you don’t need outside philosophy to teach or better articulate the faith, but the fathers clearly considered it permissible in their use of common philosophical language to articulate the doctrine of the Trinity at Nicaea and Constantinople I.
@ProtecttheFaith “There was no basis for the uptick of Arianism in the decrees of Nicea.”

Exactly. And just like Nicaea, there is no substantive relationship between things promulgated at Vatican II (like the vernacular) and things like a mass acceptance abortion.
@QuestionTrinity It’s highly unlikely that Nicaea’s mention of “light” is the same as how John 1 uses the term.

Even if it was, this would be like asking “If the Son is begotten of the Father, how does the Spirit proceed from Him?”

Either option doesn’t contradict Trinitarian theology.
@Real_Rye_Bread @OrthoTrenbalone @Christianus47 A lot of information is wrong here:

1) Leo (as seen below) didn’t say Canon 28 was automatically void because of Nicaea. That was the justification for his decision, but the annulment derived from the particular authority of his office. From Letter 105. https://t.co/Ufc5y4lUe2
@Real_Rye_Bread @OrthoTrenbalone @Christianus47 “By the blessed Apostle Peter's authority we absolutely dis-annul in comprehensive terms.”

If it required no further attention than by itself being contrary to Nicaea he wouldn’t have said that.
@SIV012 @SnorkytheOrca What part of the Acts of Second Nicaea are you referencing?
@SnorkytheOrca O: “Some bishops didn’t sign, therefore the Council was never official!”

A: In the history of Councils, there are numerous instances of attendees not signing and the Council still being recognized. The most obvious example were the three holdouts at the Council of Nicaea.
@TeDeum46060503 @PDamian19 That’s clearly what’s being communicated. Consider Pope Hadrian’s epistle accepted and admitted to Second Nicaea (left), or Pope Leo well before either of these councils (right).

Vatican I simply reiterated what was always the case. https://t.co/UbDfbsmzK1
@TeDeum46060503 But how so? What part or section of Vatican I are you referring to?

And that's not what Nicaea II says. What is the "rule for councils" it describes in the graphic you posted? It's not what you described just now.
@TinKnowledge Because Christ (Matthew 9:6), his disciples (John 1:1-14), the prophets that foretold him (Isaiah 9:6) and the Church he founded (Nicaea, Chalcedon, etc) say he was.
@TradDave @EXPOSINGLIES10 @TheRealLogosT @CatholicismFan Plus even if that were even somewhat true, do you know what else was composed with the input of non-Catholics?

The Nicene Creed - particularly in terminology that was publicly advocated by an unbaptized Constantine. The Church still righteously and correctly approved it.
@WIGutie @wignatgroyper @john_alitz1 This is a belief that's also historically evident. Consider this letter written from the Apostolic See to the Second Council of Nicaea, stating that the Apostolic See remains undefiled to the end: https://t.co/wr4ViO7Mif
@WilliamHD0124 @EricB0709 @noah_nonsense @DonaldJTrumpJr Holidays and the biblical canon are not political issues and Nicaea was attended by the bishops to respond to the Arian heresy. 

It was a responsibility of the Emperor to mediate large disputes within the empire at the time, but the Council wasn’t attended for politics.
@chrstianwisdom @FrDavidPalmer His annulling of a canon confirmed by a council shows that the Pope had the final say over his fellow bishops - a primacy of power. He doesn't say this can't happen because of Nicaea, but rather that he personally annuls it by his Petrine authority in respect to that premise.
@chrstianwisdom @FrDavidPalmer Leo saw Canon 28 as contrary to what was established at the Council of Nicaea, so he annulled it. This is mentioned in a letter he wrote to Empress Pulcheria Augusta (Letter 105). https://t.co/zulnPdU9dq
@coonkirk777 @ApostolicBible1 @TheCleanB3 @Persian6130 If it began the Trinity heresy why was the term Trinity being used long before the council?

Nicaea was called in response to Arianism because of its opposition to Trinitarian orthodoxy. It didn’t create the doctrine, but formally recognized its orthodox status.
@ghost_of_Nephi This may sound contradictory at first, but because time itself is a construct and this took place outside of the intervals of time (past, present, future), there was never a point when the Son didn’t exist (hence the Nicene articulation of “begotten not made”).
@iRealRetr0 @HMuppet37 Begotten denotes how Christ is “begotten not made” from the Father as formally described in the Nicene creed. The distinction is drawn to attribute cause of existence while not discounting the eternal and uncreated status of the son.
@jawadbalaghi I could see the argument if it is a condemnation of some heretical reception of Nicene Trinitarianism. 

But if that’s true, could it even be said that the Quran truly condemns Trinitarianism to begin with (if what’s being described are heretical variants)?
@joelmorin @Bug_Hall Someone obviously hasn’t read Vatican I, Nicaea II, or Constantinople III.
@joepemberton76 @KatelynTweeter You realize Constantine favored Arians and his immediate successors viciously persecuted Christians who affirmed the Nicene creed, right?

Pope Liberius was literally exiled by Constantine’s son for refusing to abandon the creed. https://t.co/BiXD45HDqg
@john_alitz1 @wignatgroyper The early Fathers were actually quite confident that the Pope couldn’t err on matters of doctrine. This is a letter from the apostolic see admitted to Second Nicaea

As for statements made Ex Cathedra, we can point to other historical examples (like Leo’s Tome) to derive support. https://t.co/b5osX9UaZx
@orthodox_luke @GregoryPalamas @repealthe20th Or rather, *Nicene
@orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 And as just shown, different versions of the Nicene Creed do absolutely nothing to injure our position. If you really want to stress this, you’re only hurting yourself for reasons already provided.
@orthodox_luke @matthewpao1 If you want to make the argument that different creedal texts automatically means two different confessions of faith, then you’re saying the EO recite a different confession of faith than Nicaea, as you recite the Nicene-Constantinople version of the creed.
@sl33pty Regarding the Filioque, the Filioque is no more of a change to the Nicene Creed than when First Constantinople added "who proceeds from the Father."

Chalcedon made clear that clauses which are added do not count as "changes" so long as they are theologically proper. https://t.co/vgG7UgeHam
@unworthy_prod @luke_rozmajzl @GTS9911 @Jesus_porvida @BiteMePunks02 Papal infallibility and the immaculate conception not being formally articulated until some years ago isn’t any more of a change than Trinitarianism not being formally articulated until Nicaea.

There’s no change to the deposit of faith present, just formal recognition.
By this logic one could say the Council of Nicaea was a “disaster for the Church” because of the massive uptick in Arianism that followed. https://t.co/5U7q1dJemv
The left graphic is Vatican I and the right graphic is Nicaea II.

Also, “the end of the Church”? What in the world are you talking about? The Church is never going to “end” by divine guarantee. https://t.co/tBf3WDCuSY
“But Nicaea never taught Arianism!”

Exactly.
“It is a government supported term”

Her ahistorical dating of the term aside, I wonder if she knows that the Roman government viciously persecuted Trinitarians after Nicaea. https://t.co/Sc0zuTeKRZ
2025 Jubileo y Nicea https://t.co/T3Dq7Gw811
2025 Jubileo y Nicea.
Aun teniendo diversos calendarios, coincidimos santificando los Domingos. Para Pascua unificada, el calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado es conforme a Nicea (Prácticamente Rusia la excepción de la regla).
Aún así el año litúrgico tiene sentido. La Pascua fijada según Nicea y el Nuevo Calendario (Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado). Orientales como excepción de la regla todavía sin caer en la cuenta de la necesaria corrección del Juliano.
Camino a Jubileo y Nicea 2025 y centenario del Cómputus Alejandrino en 2026.
Comunión ya posible en conciencia. El Patriarcado Greco-ortodoxo de Jerusalén y el de Moscú pueden tener la última palabra en cuanto al Calendario, que es conforme al Concilio de Nicea I.
Considerando la duración del año trópico de 365,2422 o más exacto 365,24219 la próxima rectificación del calendario sería Dios mediante en 3200 y sus múltiplos, no bisiestos. Ahora basta con que los cristianos orientales quiten los 13 días de desfase actuales según Nicea.
Cristianos orientales con 13 días de desfase actualmente según Nicea.
De camino a Nicea 2025. Oración por Rusia. https://t.co/zUHCFHPQVc
De la crisis de 2008, apertura del G-7/8 al G-20. De la guerra de Ucrania, mayor protagonismo de la Asamblea General de la ONU. En Jubileo 2025 avance en la Comunión de los cristianos con Encuentro de Nicea D.m.
De los cristianos ortodoxos depende la Pascua unificada, siendo más fácil para ellos adoptar el Nuevo Calendario según Nicea que el Easter Act 1928, también posible en tiempos actuales.
De los cristianos ortodoxos depende la Pascua unificada, siendo más fácil para ellos adoptar el Nuevo Calendario según Nicea que el Easter Act, también posible en tiempos actuales.
El 14 de septiembre Encuentro Interreligioso en Kasajistán. Si al menos el Patriarca de Moscú se diera cuenta de que esa fecha no es el día 1 habríamos avanzado en la Comunión entre los cristianos según el Concilio de Nicea. Desfase de 13 días del equinoccio de primavera Juliano.
En España, tierra de Fe arraigada y de misioneros que van por el mundo no ha habido grandes escándalos por los sacerdotes. Sí por ejemplo en Chile, plagado de sectas. Estamos con el Concilio Vaticano II y el presente Sínodo. También por el Ecumenismo así en Nicea 2025.
En el Calendario Juliano seguido por los cristianos orientales hay un retraso del equinoccio de primavera (21 de marzo) para establecer la fecha de Pascua según Nicea I de 13 días actualmente.
En el Concilio de Nicea I se reunió toda la Cristiandad. Ahora en 2025 no debe haber un encuentro exclusivo de católicos y ortodoxos sino también contar con los protestantes.
Jesucristo, el Buen Pastor. El Evangelio, la Palabra de Dios. Desde la Fe en la Santísima Trinidad y la Esperanza en la Resurrección y Vida Eterna: Comulgar por Pascua de Resurrección (según Nicea y el calendario común) y obrar siempre en la Misericordia.
Junto a la Iglesia Católica por la Comunión. Pascua fijada desde el Primer Concilio Ecuménico, Nicea I y por el Nuevo Calendario (Gregoriano con múltiplos de 3200 no bisiestos D.m. o Juliano Revisado).
La Liga Árabe debe decidir sobre Palestina y el Sáhara. Para Domingo fijo de Pascua, trascendiendo Nicea, Easter Act 1928 (entre el 9 y el 15 de abril).
La Pascua Universal por el Calendario Gregoriano y el Cómputus Alejandrino es conforme a Nicea I.
Los Coptos con el cálculo de la fecha de Pascua según Nicea I, considerando equinoccio de primavera y luna llena también nos acercan a judíos y musulmanes con calendarios respectivos lunisolar y lunar. Su meridiano es prácticamente el de Jerusalén.
Nicea 2025 entre católicos, ortodoxos y protestantes. En la ONU, protagonismo de la Asamblea General. Acuerdos entre los agentes sociales con mayor implicación de los sindicatos.
Nicea 2025. Palestina y Sáhara 2020-30. África 2063.
Nicea 2025: Pascua unificada.
IV Periodo de Descolonización (2020-30): Palestina y Sáhara.
Agenda 2063 de la Unión Africana.
D.m.
Nicea 2025: debería estar cantada la adopción por todas las Iglesias del calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado.
IV Periodo de Descolonización (2020-30): tendría que ser tiempo de Palestina y el Sáhara.
A largo plazo pero trabajando ya por la agenda 2063 de África.
No creo que los cristianos ortodoxos aceptasen una fecha de Pascua distinta a la fijada por Nicea I. Sólo basta corregir los 13 días de desfase actuales en el calendario Juliano.
No creo que los cristianos ortodoxos aceptasen una fecha de Pascua distinta a la fijada por Nicea I. Sólo basta corregir los 13 días de desfase actuales en el calendario Juliano.
No es de extrañar que los mismos rusos que se oponen a la Pascua unificada sean los que provocan la guerra, crisis económica, enfermedad y muerte. Aquella está fijada por Nicea y el calendario Gregoriano. Sólo Dios sabe el día y la hora. Comunión entre los cristianos. CARIDAD.
No se espera la unión de las Iglesias. Sería bonito celebrar la Pascua común desde Nicea 2025; solo necesario corregir los 13 días de desfase actuales en el calendario Juliano. Caridad.
Oración por Rusia. Feliz Navidad y próspero año nuevo con el calendario Gregoriano conforme a Nicea I.
Para Domingo fijo de Pascua, trascendiendo Nicea, Easter Act 1928 (del 9 al 15 de abril). El Estado de Palestina en la ONU. Desarrollo de la UA, de la que la República Saharaui es miembro.
Para Domingo fijo de Pascua, trascendiendo Nicea, Easter Act 1928 (entre el 9 y el 15 de abril).
Para Pascua Común basta con que los cristianos orientales corrijan los 13 días de retraso actuales del equinoccio de primavera, 21 de marzo según el concilio de Nicea I. PAZ.
Para Pascua Común, eliminación de los 13 días de desfase actuales del calendario por los Orientales conforme a Nicea. Ya el Gregoriano podría corregirse con los múltiplos de 3200 no bisiestos D.m.
Pascua Común según Nicea y el Calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado. Caridad.
Pascua según Concilio de Nicea I, Cómputus Alejandrino y Calendario Gregoriano con múltiplos de 3200 no bisiestos D.m.
Pascua según Nicea y el Calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado.
Podemos saber fácilmente cuando es un nuevo año por el inicio de curso (estudio y trabajo). Ya no necesariamente por Pascua; tampoco se ponen de acuerdo las Iglesias pero está bien fijada la más universal según Nicea y el Calendario Gregoriano.
Por celebrar las Fiestas en Común, lo más fácil es que cinco Patriarcados Ortodoxos que faltan retiren el desfase de 13 días del equinoccio de primavera conforme a Nicea I.
Por la Pascua según Nicea: Calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado. Comunión entre los cristianos. Caridad.
Por que Rusia adopte el calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado según Nicea y no se vea tan diferente que hasta ha roto la Comunión con Constantinopla. Caridad sobre todo.
Puedo ir a cualquier Iglesia que confiese la Santísima Trinidad con la Esperanza en la Resurrección y Vida Eterna por la Caridad. Comunión. Solo me pensaría mucho acudir a la Ortodoxa Rusa por su apoyo a la guerra; A su pesar está fijada la Pascua por Nicea y Nuevo Calendario.
Realmente en comulgar una vez al año (así por Pascua según Nicea) se queda en poco la Fe Cristiana. Deberíamos acudir más a Misa y recibir el Sacramento como Gracia para obrar en la Misericordia, empezando por algunos Domingos y conforme Dios nos vaya llamando.
Rusia, el problema actual, también reticente a la Pascua unificada. ¿Acudirá el Patriarca de Moscú al encuentro de Nicea en 2025? Esperemos.
Sin ser consecuentes con Nicea ¿Qué sentido tiene elegir un determinado Domingo de abril para la Pascua?
Solidaridad y Eucaristía (Gracia de Dios, celebrando juntos según Nicea I y el calendario común).
Toda la Cristiandad celebrando la Pascua junta a falta de unas pocas Iglesias Orientales, que ya muchas están con el Calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado. Prácticamente falta Rusia. ¿Por qué complicarse tanto? Conforme a Nicea I, corrección de 13 días de desfase actuales.
Unidad de los cristianos: Pascua Común según Nicea y el Calendario Gregoriano o Juliano Revisado. Caridad.
